ICLR,2022,Selective Token Generation for Few-shot Language Modeling,"Natural language modeling with limited training data is challenging problem, and many algorithms make use of large-scale pretrained language models (PLMs) for this due to its great generalization ability. Among these transfer learning algorithms from PLMs, additive learning that incorporates a task-specific adapter on top of the fixed PLM has been popularly used to alleviate the severe overfitting problem in the few-shot setting. However, this added task-specific adapter is generally trained by maximum likelihood estimation that can easily suffer from the so-called exposure bias problem, especially in sequential text generation. Therefore, in this work, we develop a novel additive learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) for few-shot natural language generation (NLG) tasks. In particular, we propose to use a selective token generation between the transformer-based PLM and the task-specific adapter during both training and inference. This output token selection between the two generators allows the adapter to take into account only on the task-relevant parts in sequence generation, and therefore makes it more robust to overfitting as well as more stable in RL training. In addition, in order to obtain the complementary adapter from the PLM for each few-shot task, we exploit a separate selecting module that is also simultaneously trained using RL. Experimental results on various few-shot NLG tasks including data-to-text generation and text summarization demonstrate that the proposed selective token generation significantly outperforms the previous additive learning algorithms based on the PLMs.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,How to Adapt Your Large-Scale Vision-and-Language Model,"Pre-training large-scale vision and language models (e.g. CLIP) has shown promising results in representation and transfer learning. We investigate the question of how to efficiently adapt these models to downstream tasks. For image classification, linear probes have been the standard for ease of use and efficiency, while for language, other approaches like prompt tuning have emerged. We analyze several fine-tuning methods across a diverse set of image classification tasks across two spectra investigating the amount and similarity of downstream data to that of pretraining one. We find that just tuning LayerNorm parameters is a surprisingly effective baseline across the board. We further demonstrate a simple yet effective strategy that combines LayerNorm-tuning with general fine-tuning methods to improve their performance and benchmark them on few-shot adaption and distribution shift tasks. Finally, we provide an empirical analysis and recommend general recipes for efficient transfer learning of vision and language models.

ICLR,2022,Metric Learning on Temporal Graphs via Few-Shot Examples,"Graph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar graphs are closer and dissimilar graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. In many real-world applications, the graphs are typically evolving over time; labeling graph data is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. However, state-of-the-art graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs; Furthermore, most of these techniques require abundant labeled examples for training in the representation learning process. To address the two aforementioned problems, we wish to learn a distance metric only over fewer temporal graphs, which metric could not only help accurately categorize seen temporal graphs but also be adapted smoothly to unseen temporal graphs. In this paper, we first propose the streaming-snapshot model to describe temporal graphs on different time scales. Then we propose the MetaTag framework: 1) to learn the metric over a limited number of streaming-snapshot modeled temporal graphs, 2) and adapt the learned metric to unseen temporal graphs via a few examples. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of MetaTag in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms for temporal graph classification problems.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,HyperTransformer: Attention-Based CNN Model Generation from Few Samples,"In this work we propose a HyperTransformer, a transformer based model that generates all weights of a CNN model directly from the support samples. This approach allows to use a high-capacity model for encoding task-dependent variations in the weights of a smaller model. We show for multiple few-shot benchmarks with different architectures and datasets that our method beats or matches that of the traditional learning methods in a few-shot regime. Specifically, we show that for very small target models, our method can generate significantly better performing models than traditional few-shot learning methods. For larger models we discover that applying generation to the last layer only, allows to produce competitive or better results while being end-to-end differentiable. Finally, we extend our approach to semi-supervised regime utilizing unlabeled samples in the support set and further improving few-shot performance in the presence of unlabeled data.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2022,Image2Point: 3D Point-Cloud Understanding with 2D Image Pretrained Models,"3D point-clouds and 2D images are different visual representations of the physical world. While human vision can understand both representations, computer vision models designed for 2D image and 3D point-cloud understanding are quite different.
Our paper explores the potential for transferring between these two representations by empirically investigating the feasibility of the transfer, the benefits of the transfer, and shedding light on why the transfer works.
We discovered that we can indeed use the same architecture and pretrained weights of a neural net model to understand both images and point-clouds. Specifically, we can transfer the pretrained image model to a point-cloud model by \textit{inflating} 2D convolutional filters to 3D and then \textbf{f}inetuning the \textbf{i}mage-\textbf{p}retrained models (FIP). 
We discover that, surprisingly, models with minimal finetuning efforts --- only on input, output, and optionally batch normalization layers, can achieve competitive performance on 3D point-cloud classification, beating a wide range of point-cloud models that adopt task-specific architectures and use a variety of tricks. When finetuning the whole model, the performance further improves significantly. Meanwhile, we also find that FIP improves data efficiency, achieving up to 10.0 points top-1 accuracy gain on few-shot classification. It also speeds up the training of point-cloud models by up to 11.1x to reach a target accuracy.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Attentional meta-learners for few-shot polythetic classification,"Polythetic classifications, based on shared patterns of features that need neither be universal nor constant among members of a class, are common in the natural world and greatly outnumber monothetic classifications over a set of features. We show that threshold meta-learners, such as Prototypical Networks, require an embedding dimension that is exponential in the number of features to emulate these functions. In contrast, attentional classifiers, such as Matching Networks, are polythetic by default and able to solve these problems with a linear embedding dimension. However, we find that in the presence of task-irrelevant features, inherent to meta-learning problems, attentional models are susceptible to misclassification. To address this challenge, we propose a self-attention feature-selection mechanism that adaptively dilutes non-discriminative features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in meta-learning Boolean functions, and synthetic and real-world few-shot learning tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Efficient Token Mixing for Transformers via Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,"Vision transformers have delivered tremendous success in representation learning. This is primarily due to effective token mixing through self attention. However, this scales quadratically with the number of pixels, which becomes infeasible for high-resolution inputs. To cope with this challenge, we propose Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) as an efficient token mixer that learns to mix in the Fourier domain. AFNO is based on a principled foundation of operator learning which allows us to frame token mixing as a continuous global convolution without any dependence on the input resolution. This principle was previously used to design FNO, which solves global convolution efficiently in the Fourier domain and has shown promise in learning challenging PDEs. To handle challenges in visual representation learning such as discontinuities in images and high resolution inputs, we propose principled architectural modifications to FNO which results in memory and computational efficiency. This includes imposing a block-diagonal structure on the channel mixing weights, adaptively sharing weights across tokens, and sparsifying the frequency modes via soft-thresholding and shrinkage. The resulting model is highly parallel with a quasi-linear complexity and has linear memory in the sequence size. AFNO outperforms self-attention mechanisms for few-shot segmentation in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. For Cityscapes segmentation with the Segformer-B3 backbone, AFNO can handle a sequence size of 65k and outperforms other efficient self-attention mechanisms.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation with Generative Language Models Only,"We show how to derive state-of-the-art unsupervised neural machine translation systems from generatively pre-trained language models. Our method consists of three steps: \emph{few-shot amplification}, \emph{distillation}, and \emph{backtranslation}. We first use the zero-shot translation ability of large pretrained language models to generate translations for a small set of unlabeled sentences.  We then amplify these zero-shot translations by using them as few-shot demonstrations for sampling a larger synthetic dataset. This dataset is then distilled by discarding the few-shot demonstrations and then fine-tuning. During backtranslation, we repeatedly generate translations for a set of inputs and then fine-tune a single language model on both directions of the translation task at once, ensuring cycle-consistency by swapping the roles of gold monotext and generated translations when fine-tuning. By using our method to leverage GPT-3's zero-shot translation capability, we achieve a new state-of-the-art in unsupervised translation on the WMT14 English-French benchmark, attaining a BLEU score of 42.1.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Prototype memory and attention mechanisms for few shot image generation,"Recent discoveries indicate that the neural codes in the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys are complex, diverse and sparse. This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these “grandmother cells."" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing within the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized via a memory-based attention operation, which we define as Memory Concept Attention (MoCA). To test our proposal, we show in a few-shot image generation task, that having a prototype memory during attention can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, as well as improve the robustness of the model. Interestingly, we also find that our attentional memory mechanism can implicitly modify the horizontal connections by updating the transformation into the prototype embedding space for self-attention. Insofar as GANs can be seen as plausible models for reasoning about the top-down synthesis in the analysis-by-synthesis loop of the hierarchical visual cortex, our findings demonstrate a plausible computational role for these “prototype concept"" neurons in visual processing in the brain.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,A Simple Approach to Adversarial Robustness in Few-shot Image Classification,"Few-shot image classification, where the goal is to generalize to tasks with limited labeled data, has seen great progress over the years. However, the classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing a question regarding their generalization capabilities. Recent works have tried to combine meta-learning approaches with adversarial training to improve the robustness of few-shot classifiers. We show that a simple transfer-learning based approach can be used to train adversarially robust few-shot classifiers.  We also present a method for novel classification task based on calibrating the centroid of the few-shot category towards the base classes.  We show that standard adversarial training on base categories along with centroid-based classifier in the novel categories, outperforms or is on-par with state-of-the-art advanced methods on standard benchmarks such as Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets. Our method is simple and easy to scale, and with little effort can lead to robust few-shot classifiers.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,A Broad Dataset is All You Need for One-Shot Object Detection,"Is it possible to detect arbitrary objects from a single example? A central problem of all existing attempts at one-shot object detection is the generalization gap: Object categories used during training are detected much more reliably than novel ones. We here show that this generalization gap can be nearly closed by increasing the number of object categories used during training. Doing so allows us to improve generalization from seen to unseen classes from 45% to 89% and improve the state-of-the-art on COCO by 5.4 AP50 (from 22.0 to 27.5). 
We verify that the effect is caused by the number of categories and not the number of training samples, and that it holds for different models, backbones and datasets. This result suggests that the key to strong few-shot detection models may not lie in sophisticated metric learning approaches, but instead simply in scaling the number of categories. We hope that our findings will help to better understand the challenges of few-shot learning and encourage future data annotation efforts to focus on wider datasets with a broader set of categories rather than gathering more samples per category.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Dense Gaussian Processes for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation is a challenging dense prediction task, which entails segmenting a novel query image given only a small annotated support set. The key problem is thus to design a method that aggregates detailed information from the support set, while being robust to large variations in appearance and context. To this end, we propose a few-shot segmentation method based on dense Gaussian process (GP) regression. Given the support set, our dense GP learns the mapping from local deep image features to mask values, capable of capturing complex appearance distributions. Furthermore, it provides a principled means of capturing uncertainty, which serves as another powerful cue for the final segmentation, obtained by a CNN decoder. Instead of a one-dimensional mask output, we further exploit the end-to-end learning capabilities of our approach to learn a high-dimensional output space for the GP. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art for both 1-shot and 5-shot FSS on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, achieving an absolute gain of $+14.9$ mIoU in the COCO-20$^i$ 5-shot setting. Furthermore, the segmentation quality of our approach scales gracefully when increasing the support set size, while achieving robust cross-dataset transfer.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models,"Large pre-trained language models perform remarkably well on tasks that can be done ""in one pass"", such as generating realistic text or synthesizing computer programs. However, they struggle with tasks that require unbounded multi-step computation, such as adding integers  or executing programs. Surprisingly, we find that these same models are able to perform complex multi-step computations --- even in the few-shot regime --- when asked to perform the operation ""step by step"", showing the results of intermediate computations. In particular, we train transformers to perform multi-step computations by asking them to emit intermediate computation steps into a ""scratchpad"". On a series of increasingly complex tasks ranging from long addition to the execution of arbitrary programs, we show that scratchpads dramatically improve the ability of language models to perform multi-step computations.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2022,A Study on Representation Transfer for Few-Shot Learning,"Few-shot classification aims to learn to classify new object categories well using only a few labeled examples. Transfering feature representations from other models is a popular approach for solving few-shot classification problems.In this work we perform a systematic study of various feature representations for few-shot classification, including representations learned from MAML, supervised classification, and several common self-supervised tasks. We find that learning from more complex tasks tend to give better representations for few-shot classification, and thus we propose the use of representations learned from multiple tasks for few-shot classification. Coupled with new tricks on feature selection and voting to handle the issue of small sample size, our direct transfer learning method offers performance comparable to state-of-art on several benchmark datasets.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2022,LFPT5: A Unified Framework for Lifelong Few-shot Language Learning Based on Prompt Tuning of T5,"Existing approaches to lifelong language learning rely on plenty of labeled data for learning a new task, which is hard to obtain in most real scenarios. Considering that humans can continually learn new tasks from a handful of examples, we expect the models also to be able to generalize well on new few-shot tasks without forgetting the previous ones. In this work, we define this more challenging yet practical problem as Lifelong Few-shot Language Learning (LFLL) and propose a unified framework for it based on prompt tuning of T5. Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage of PT's strong few-shot learning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as a task solver and a data generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task type, LFPT5 generates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and later gets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge as it learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to achieve label consistency between the previous and the current model. While adapting to a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt embeddings for the new task. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LFPT5 can be applied to various different types of tasks and significantly outperform previous methods in different LFLL settings.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,A theoretically grounded characterization of feature representations,"A large body of work has explored how learned feature representations can be useful for a variety of downstream tasks. This is true even when the downstream tasks differ greatly from the actual objective used to (pre)train the feature representation. This observation underlies the success of, e.g., few-shot learning, transfer learning and self-supervised learning, among others. However, very little is understood about why such transfer is successful, and more importantly, how one should choose the pre-training task. As a first step towards this understanding, we ask: what makes a feature representation good for a target task? We present simple, intuitive measurements of the feature space that are good predictors of downstream task performance. We present theoretical results showing how these measurements can be used to bound the error of the downstream classifiers, and show empirically that these bounds correlate well with actual downstream performance. Finally, we show that our bounds are practically useful for choosing the right pre-trained representation for a target task.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Knowledge Infused Decoding,"Pre-trained language models (LMs) have been shown to memorize a substantial amount of knowledge from the pre-training corpora; however, they are still limited in recalling factually correct knowledge given a certain context. Hence. they tend to suffer from counterfactual or hallucinatory generation when used in knowledge-intensive natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Recent remedies to this problem focus on modifying either the pre-training or task fine-tuning objectives to incorporate knowledge, which normally require additional costly training or architecture modification of LMs for practical applications.

We present Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID)---a novel decoding algorithm for generative LMs, which dynamically infuses external knowledge into each step of the LM decoding. Specifically, we maintain a local knowledge memory based on the current context, interacting with a dynamically created external knowledge trie, and continuously update the local memory as a knowledge-aware constraint to guide decoding via reinforcement learning. On six diverse knowledge-intensive NLG tasks, task-agnostic LMs (e.g., GPT-2 and BART) armed with KID outperform many task-optimized state-of-the-art models, and show particularly strong performance in few-shot scenarios over seven related knowledge-infusion techniques. Human evaluation confirms KID's ability to generate more relevant and factual language for the input context when compared with multiple baselines. Finally, KID also alleviates exposure bias and provides stable generation quality when generating longer sequences.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Few-shot graph link prediction with domain adaptation,"Real world link prediction problem often deals with data coming from multiple imbalanced domains. Similar problems in computer vision are often referred to as Few-Shot Learning (FSL) problems. However, for graph link prediction, this problem has rarely been addressed and explored. In this work, we propose an adversarial training based modification to the current state-of-the-arts link prediction method to solve this problem. We introduce a domain discriminator on pairs of graph-level embedding. We then use the discriminator to improve the model in an adversarial way, such that the graph embeddings generated by the model are domain agnostic. We test our proposal on 3 benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that, when domain differences exist, our method creates better graph embeddings that are more evenly distributed across domains and generates better prediction outcomes.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,On the Role of Neural Collapse in Transfer Learning,"We study the ability of foundation models to learn representations for classification that are transferable to new, unseen classes. Recent results in the literature show that representations learned by a single classifier over many classes are competitive on few-shot learning problems with representations learned by special-purpose algorithms designed for such problems. In this paper, we provide an explanation for this behavior based on the recently observed phenomenon that the features learned by overparameterized classification networks show an interesting clustering property, called neural collapse. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that neural collapse generalizes to new samples from the training classes, and -- more importantly -- to new classes as well, allowing foundation models to provide feature maps that work well in transfer learning and, specifically, in the few-shot setting.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

In this paper, we show how a fairly simple loss meta-learning approach can substantially improve regression results. Specifically, we target forecasting of time series and explore case studies grounded on real-world data, and show that meta-learned losses can benefit the quality of the prediction both in cases that are apparently naive and in practical scenarios where the performance metric is complex, time-correlated, non-differentiable, or not known a-priori.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Hierarchical Few-Shot Imitation with Skill Transition Models,"A desirable property of autonomous agents is the ability to both solve long-horizon problems and generalize to unseen tasks. Recent advances in data-driven skill learning have shown that extracting behavioral priors from offline data can enable agents to solve challenging long-horizon tasks with reinforcement learning. However, generalization to tasks unseen during behavioral prior training remains an outstanding challenge. To this end, we present Few-shot Imitation with Skill Transition Models (FIST), an algorithm that extracts skills from offline data and utilizes them to generalize to unseen tasks given a few downstream demonstrations. FIST learns an inverse skill dynamics model, a distance function, and utilizes a semi-parametric approach for imitation. We show that FIST is capable of generalizing to new tasks and substantially outperforms prior baselines in navigation experiments requiring traversing unseen parts of a large maze and 7-DoF robotic arm experiments requiring manipulating previously unseen objects in a kitchen.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2022,The Effect of diversity in Meta-Learning,"Few-shot learning aims to learn representations that can tackle novel tasks given a small number of examples. Recent studies show that task distribution plays a vital role in the performance of the model. Conventional wisdom is that task diversity should improve the performance of meta-learning. In this work, we find evidence to the contrary; we study different task distributions on a myriad of models and datasets to evaluate the effect of task diversity on meta-learning algorithms. For this experiment, we train on multiple datasets, and with three broad classes of meta-learning models - Metric-based (i.e., Protonet, Matching Networks), Optimization-based (i.e., MAML, Reptile, and MetaOptNet), and Bayesian meta-learning models (i.e., CNAPs). Our experiments demonstrate that the effect of task diversity on all these algorithms follows a similar trend, and task diversity does not seem to offer any benefits to the learning of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that even a handful of tasks, repeated over multiple batches, would be sufficient to achieve a performance similar to uniform sampling and draws into question the need for additional tasks to create better models.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性

Given a pre-trained multimodal embedding model, where language and images are projected in the same semantic space (in this case CLIP by OpenAI), CoLLIE learns a transformation function that adjusts the language embeddings when needed to accommodate new language use. Unlike traditional few-shot learning, the model does not just learn new classes and labels, but can also generalize to similar language use. We verify the model's performance on two different tasks of continual learning and show that it can efficiently learn and generalize from only a few examples, with little interference with the model's original zero-shot performance.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2022,How Does the Task Landscape Affect MAML Performance?,"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) has become increasingly popular for training models that can quickly adapt to new tasks via one or few stochastic gradient descent steps. However, the MAML objective is significantly more difficult to optimize compared to standard non-adaptive learning (NAL), and little is understood about how much MAML improves over NAL in terms of the fast adaptability of their solutions in various scenarios. We analytically address this issue in a linear regression setting consisting of a mixture of easy and hard tasks, where hardness is related to the rate that gradient descent converges on the task. Specifically, we prove that in order for MAML to achieve substantial gain over NAL, (i) there must be some discrepancy in hardness among the tasks, and (ii) the optimal solutions of the hard tasks must be closely packed with the center far from the center of the easy tasks optimal solutions. We also give numerical and analytical results suggesting that these insights apply to two-layer neural networks. Finally, we provide few-shot image classification experiments that support our insights for when MAML should be used and emphasize the importance of training MAML on hard tasks in practice.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Evolutionary Diversity Optimization with Clustering-based Selection for Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant successes, which aims to obtain a single policy maximizing the expected cumulative rewards for a given task. However, in many real-world scenarios, e.g., navigating in complex environments and controlling robots, one may need to find a set of policies having both high rewards and diverse behaviors, which can bring better exploration and robust few-shot adaptation. Recently, some methods have been developed by using evolutionary techniques, including iterative reproduction and selection of policies. However, due to the inefficient selection mechanisms, these methods cannot fully guarantee both high quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose EDO-CS, a new Evolutionary Diversity Optimization algorithm with Clustering-based Selection. In each iteration, the policies are divided into several clusters based on their behaviors, and a high-quality policy is selected from each cluster for reproduction. EDO-CS also adaptively balances the importance between quality and diversity in the reproduction process. Experiments on various (i.e., deceptive and multi-modal) continuous control tasks, show the superior performance of EDO-CS over previous methods, i.e., EDO-CS can achieve a set of policies with both high quality and diversity efficiently while previous methods cannot.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2022,Learning from One and Only One Shot,"Humans can generalize from one or a few examples, and even from very little pre-training on similar tasks. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, however, typically require large data to either learn or pre-learn to transfer. Inspired by nativism, we directly model very basic human innate priors in abstract visual tasks like character or doodle recognition. The result is a white-box model that learns transformation-based topological similarity akin to how a human would naturally and unconsciously ``distort'' an object when first seeing it. Using the simple Nearest-Neighbor classifier in this similarity space, our model approaches human-level character recognition using only one to ten examples per class and nothing else (no pre-training). This is in contrast to one-shot and few-shot settings that require significant pre-training. On standard benchmarks including MNIST, EMNIST-letters, and the harder Omniglot challenge, our model outperforms both neural-network-based and classical ML methods in the ``tiny-data'' regime, including few-shot learning models that use an extra background set to perform transfer learning. Moreover, mimicking simple clustering methods like $k$-means but in a non-Euclidean space, our model can adapt to an unsupervised setting and generate human-interpretable archetypes of a class.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,ES-Based Jacobian Enables Faster Bilevel Optimization,"Bilevel optimization (BO) has arisen as a powerful tool for solving many modern machine learning problems. However, due to the nested structure of BO, existing gradient-based methods require second-order derivative approximations via Jacobian- or/and Hessian-vector computations, which can be very costly in practice, especially with large neural network models. In this work, we propose a novel BO algorithm, which adopts Evolution Strategies (ES) based method to approximate the response Jacobian matrix in the hypergradient of BO, and hence fully eliminates all second-order computations. We call our algorithm as ESJ (which stands for the ES-based Jacobian method) and further extend it to the stochastic setting as ESJ-S. Theoretically, we characterize the convergence guarantee and computational complexity for our algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms compared to the state of the art methods on various bilevel problems. Particularly, in our experiment in the  few-shot meta-learning problem, we meta-learn the twelve millions parameters of a ResNet-12 network over the miniImageNet dataset, which evidently demonstrates the scalability of our ES-based bilevel approach and its feasibility in the large-scale setting.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,On the Importance of Firth Bias Reduction in Few-Shot Classification,"Learning accurate classifiers for novel categories from very few examples, known as few-shot image classification, is a challenging task in statistical machine learning and computer vision. The performance in few-shot classification suffers from the bias in the estimation of classifier parameters; however, an effective underlying bias reduction technique that could alleviate this issue in training few-shot classifiers has been overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias reduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction removes the $O(N^{-1})$ first order term from the small-sample bias of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Here we show that the general Firth bias reduction technique simplifies to encouraging uniform class assignment probabilities for multinomial logistic classification, and almost has the same effect in cosine classifiers. We derive an easy-to-implement optimization objective for Firth penalized multinomial logistic and cosine classifiers, which is equivalent to penalizing the cross-entropy loss with a KL-divergence between the predictions and the uniform label distribution. Then, we empirically evaluate that it is consistently effective across the board for few-shot image classification, regardless of (1) the feature representations from different backbones, (2) the number of samples per class, and (3) the number of classes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias reduction on cross-domain and imbalanced data settings.

ICLR,2022,Generalizing Few-Shot NAS with Gradient Matching,"Efficient performance estimation of architectures drawn from large search spaces is essential to Neural Architecture Search. One-Shot methods tackle this challenge by training one supernet to approximate the performance of every architecture in the search space via weight-sharing, thereby drastically reducing the search cost. However, due to coupled optimization between child architectures caused by weight-sharing, One-Shot supernet's performance estimation could be inaccurate, leading to degraded search outcomes. To address this issue, Few-Shot NAS reduces the level of weight-sharing by splitting the One-Shot supernet into multiple separated sub-supernets via edge-wise (layer-wise) exhaustive partitioning. Since each partition of the supernet is not equally important, it necessitates the design of a more effective splitting criterion. In this work, we propose a gradient matching score (GM) that leverages gradient information at the shared weight for making informed splitting decisions. Intuitively, gradients from different child models can be used to identify whether they agree on how to update the shared modules, and subsequently to decide if they should share weight. Compared with exhaustive partitioning, the proposed criterion significantly reduces the branching factor per edge. This allows us to split more edges (layers) for a given budget, resulting in substantially improved performance as NAS search spaces usually include dozens of edges (layers). Extensive empirical evaluations of the proposed method on a wide range of search spaces (NASBench-201, DARTS, MobileNet Space), datasets (cifar10, cifar100, ImageNet) and search algorithms (DARTS, SNAS, RSPS, ProxylessNAS, OFA) demonstrate that it significantly outperforms its Few-Shot counterparts while surpassing previous comparable methods in terms of the accuracy of derived architectures.

ICLR,2022,Few-Shot Classification with Task-Adaptive Semantic Feature Learning,"Few-shot classification aims to learn a classifier that categorizes objects of unseen classes with limited samples. One general approach is to mine as much information as possible from limited samples. This can be achieved by incorporating data aspects from multiple modals. However, existing multi-modality methods only use additional modality in support samples while adhering to a single modal in query samples. Such approach could lead to information imbalance between support and query samples, which confounds model generalization from support to query samples. Towards this problem, we propose a task-adaptive semantic feature learning mechanism to incorporates semantic features for both support and query samples. The semantic feature learner is trained episodic-wisely by regressing from the feature vectors of support samples. Then the query samples can obtain the semantic features with this module. Such method maintains a consistent training scheme between support and query samples and enables direct model transfer from support to query datasets, which significantly improves model generalization. We develop two modality combination implementations: feature concatenation and feature fusion, based on the semantic feature learner. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts, proving the effectiveness of our method.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,A Closer Look at Prototype Classifier for Few-shot Image Classification,"The prototypical network is a prototype classifier based on meta-learning and is widely used for few-shot learning because it classifies unseen examples by constructing class-specific prototypes without adjusting hyper-parameters during meta-testing.
Interestingly, recent research has attracted a lot of attention, showing that a linear classifier with fine-tuning, which does not use a meta-learning algorithm, performs comparably with the prototypical network.
However, fine-tuning requires additional hyper-parameters when adapting a model to a new environment. In addition, although the purpose of few-shot learning is to enable the model to quickly adapt to a new environment, fine-tuning needs to be applied every time a new class appears, making fast adaptation difficult.
In this paper, 
we analyze how a prototype classifier works equally well without fine-tuning and meta-learning.
We experimentally found that directly using the feature vector extracted using standard pre-trained models to construct a prototype classifier in meta-testing does not perform as well as the prototypical network and linear classifiers with fine-tuning and feature vectors of pre-trained models.
Thus, we derive a novel generalization bound for the prototypical network and show that focusing on the variance of the norm of a feature vector can improve performance.
We experimentally investigated several normalization methods for minimizing the variance of the norm and found that the same performance can be obtained by using the L2 normalization and embedding space transformation without fine-tuning or meta-learning.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,"Generate, Annotate, and Learn: Generative Models Advance Self-Training and Knowledge Distillation","Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has seen success in many application domains, but this success often relies on the availability of task-specific unlabeled data. Knowledge distillation (KD) has enabled compressing deep networks, achieving the best results when distilling knowledge on fresh task-specific unlabeled examples. However, task-specific unlabeled data can be challenging to find, especially for NLP problems. We present a simple framework called ""generate, annotate, and learn (GAL)"" that uses unconditional language models to synthesize in-domain unlabeled data, helping advance SSL and KD on NLP and tabular tasks. To obtain strong task-specific generative models, we either fine-tune a large language model (LLM) on inputs from specific tasks, or prompt a LLM with a few input examples to generate more unlabeled examples. Then, we use existing classifiers to annotate generated unlabeled examples with pseudo labels, which are used as additional training data or as additional prompts. GAL improves prompt-based few-shot learning on several NLP tasks. It also yields a new state-of-the-art for 6-layer transformers on the GLUE leaderboard. Finally, self-training with GAL offers large gains on four tabular tasks from the UCI repository.",⚡ 效率优化
ICLR,2022,ConFeSS: A Framework for Single Source Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,"Most current few-shot learning methods train a model from abundantly labeled base category data and then transfer and adapt the model to sparsely labeled novel category data. These methods mostly generalize well on novel categories from the same domain as the base categories but perform poorly for distant domain categories. In this paper, we propose a framework for few-shot learning coined as ConFeSS (Contrastive Learning and Feature Selection System) that tackles large domain shift between base and novel categories. The first step of our framework trains a feature extracting backbone with the contrastive loss on the base category data. Since the contrastive loss does not use supervision, the features can generalize better to distant target domains. For the second step, we train a masking module to select relevant features that are more suited to target domain classification. Finally, a classifier is fine-tuned along with the backbone such that the backbone produces features similar to the relevant ones. To evaluate our framework, we tested it on a recently introduced cross-domain few-shot learning benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms all meta-learning approaches and produces competitive results against recent cross-domain methods. Additional analyses are also performed to better understand our framework.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,Meta-free few-shot learning via representation learning with weight averaging,"Recent studies on few-shot classification using transfer learning pose challenges to the effectiveness and efficiency of episodic meta-learning algorithms. Transfer learning approaches are a natural alternative,  but they are restricted to few-shot classification. Moreover, little attention has been on the development of probabilistic models with well-calibrated uncertainty from few-shot samples, except for some Bayesian episodic learning algorithms. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we propose a new transfer learning method to obtain accurate and reliable models for few-shot regression and classification. The resulting method does not require episodic meta-learning and is called meta-free representation learning (MFRL). MFRL first finds low-rank representation generalizing well on meta-test tasks. Given the learned representation, probabilistic linear models are fine-tuned with few-shot samples to obtain models with well-calibrated uncertainty. The proposed method not only achieves the highest accuracy on a wide range of few-shot learning benchmark datasets but also correctly quantifies the prediction uncertainty. In addition, weight averaging and temperature scaling are effective in improving the accuracy and reliability of few-shot learning in existing meta-learning algorithms with a wide range of learning paradigms and model architectures.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Training Data Generating Networks: Shape Reconstruction via Bi-level Optimization,"We propose a novel 3d shape representation for 3d shape reconstruction from a single image. Rather than predicting a shape directly, we train a network to generate a training set which will be fed into another learning algorithm to define the shape. The nested optimization problem can be modeled by bi-level optimization. Specifically, the algorithms for bi-level optimization are also being used in meta learning approaches for few-shot learning. Our framework establishes a link between 3D shape analysis and few-shot learning. We combine training data generating networks with bi-level optimization algorithms to obtain a complete framework for which all components can be jointly trained. We improve upon recent work on standard benchmarks for 3d shape reconstruction.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains,"Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,An Explanation of In-context Learning as Implicit Bayesian Inference,"Large language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have the surprising ability to do in-context learning, where the model learns to do a downstream task simply by conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples. The LM learns from these examples without being explicitly pretrained to learn. Thus, it is unclear what enables in-context learning. In this paper, we study how in-context learning can emerge when pretraining documents have long-range coherence. Here, the LM must infer a latent document-level concept to generate coherent next tokens during pretraining. At test time, in-context learning occurs when the LM also infers a shared latent concept between examples in a prompt. We prove when this occurs despite a distribution mismatch between prompts and pretraining data in a setting where the pretraining distribution is a mixture of HMMs. In contrast to messy large-scale datasets used to train LMs capable of in-context learning, we generate a small-scale synthetic dataset (GINC) where Transformers and LSTMs both exhibit in-context learning. Beyond the theory, experiments on GINC exhibit large-scale real-world phenomena including improved in-context performance with model scaling (despite the same pretraining loss), sensitivity to example order, and instances where zero-shot is better than few-shot in-context learning.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Contrastive Pre-training for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval,"Information retrieval is an important component in natural language processing, for knowledge intensive tasks such as question answering and fact checking. Recently, information retrieval has seen the emergence of dense retrievers, based on neural networks, as an alternative to classical sparse methods based on term-frequency. Neural retrievers work well on the problems for which they were specifically trained, but they do not generalize as well as term-frequency methods to new domains or applications. By contrast, in many other NLP tasks, conventional self-supervised pre-training based on masking leads to strong generalization with small number of training examples. We believe this is not yet the case for information retrieval, because these pre-training methods are not well adapted to this task. In this work, we consider contrastive learning as a more natural pre-training technique for retrieval and show that it leads to models that are competitive with BM25 on many domains or applications, even without training on supervised data. Our dense pre-trained models also compare favorably against BERT pre-trained models in the few-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BEIR benchmark when fine-tuned on MS-MARCO.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,Assessing two novel distance-based loss functions for few-shot image classification,"Few-shot learning is a challenging area of research which aims to learn new concepts with only a few labeled samples of data. Recent works based on metric-learning approaches benefit from the meta-learning process in which we have episodic tasks conformed by support set (training) and query set (test), and the objective is to learn a similarity comparison metric between those sets. Due to the lack of data, the learning process of the embedding network becomes an important part of the few-shot task. In this work, we propose two different loss functions which consider the importance of the embedding vectors by looking at the intra-class and inter-class distance between the few data. The first loss function is the Proto-Triplet Loss, which is based on the original triplet loss with the modifications needed to better work on few-shot scenarios. The second loss function is based on an inter and intra class nearest neighbors score, which help us to know the quality of embeddings obtained from the trained network. Extensive experimental results on the miniImagenNet benchmark increase the accuracy performance from other metric-based few-shot learning methods by a margin of $2\%$, demonstrating the capability of these loss functions to allow the network to generalize better to previously unseen classes.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Invariance-Guided Feature Evolution  for  Few-Shot Learning,"Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to characterize the inherent visual relationship between support and query samples which can be well generalized to unseen classes so that we can accurately infer the labels of query samples from very few support samples. We observe that, in a successfully learned FSL model, this visual relationship and the learned features of the query samples should remain largely invariant across different configurations of the support set. Driven by this observation, we propose to construct a feature evolution network with an ensemble of few-shot learners evolving along different configuration dimensions. We choose to study two major parameters that control the support set configuration: the number of labeled samples per class (called shots) and the percentage of training samples (called partition) in the support set. Based on this network, we characterize and track the evolution behavior of learned query features across different shots-partition configurations, which will be minimized by a set of invariance loss functions during the training stage. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed invariance-guided feature evolution (IGFE) method significantly improves the performance and generalization capability of few-shot learning and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins, especially in cross-domain classification tasks for generalization capability test. For example, in the cross-domain test on the fine-grained CUB image classification task, our method has improved the classification accuracy by more than 5%.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Subspace Regularizers for Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning,"Few-shot class incremental learning---the problem of updating a trained classifier to discriminate among an expanded set of classes with limited labeled data---is a key challenge for machine learning systems deployed in non-stationary environments. Existing approaches to the problem rely on complex model architectures and training procedures that are difficult to tune and re-use. In this paper, we present an extremely simple approach that enables the use of ordinary logistic regression classifiers for few-shot incremental learning. The key to this approach is a new family of \textit{subspace regularization} schemes that encourage weight vectors for new classes to lie close to the subspace spanned by the weights of existing classes. When combined with pretrained convolutional feature extractors, logistic regression models trained with subspace regularization outperform specialized, state-of-the-art approaches to few-shot incremental image classification by up to 23\% on the \textit{mini}ImageNet dataset. Because of its simplicity, subspace regularization can be straightforwardly configured to incorporate additional background information about the new classes (including class names and descriptions specified in natural language); this offers additional control over the trade-off between existing and new classes. Our results show that simple geometric regularization of class representations offers an effective tool for continual learning.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Few-shot Learning with Big Prototypes,"Using dense vectors, i.e., prototypes, to represent abstract information of classes has become a common approach in low-data machine learning scenarios. Typically, prototypes are mean output embeddings over the instances for each class. In this case, prototypes have the same dimension of example embeddings, and such tensors could be regarded as ``points'' in the feature space from the geometrical perspective. But these points may lack the expressivity of the whole class-level information due to the biased sampling.
In this paper, we propose to use tensor fields (``areas'') to model prototypes to enhance the expressivity of class-level information. Specifically, we present \textit{big prototypes}, where prototypes are represented by hyperspheres with dynamic sizes. A big prototype could be effectively modeled by two sets of learnable parameters, one is the center of the hypersphere, which is an embedding with the same dimension of training examples. The other is the radius of the sphere, which is a constant. Compared with atactic manifolds with complex boundaries, representing hypersphere with parameters is immensely easier. Moreover, it is convenient to perform metric-based classification with big prototypes in few-shot learning, where we only need to calculate the distance from a data point to the surface of the hypersphere.
Extensive experiments on few-shot learning tasks across NLP and CV demonstrate the effectiveness of big prototypes.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,CPT: Colorful Prompt Tuning for Pre-trained Vision-Language Models,"Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models (VL-PTMs) have shown promising capabilities in grounding natural language in image data, facilitating a broad variety of cross-modal tasks. However, we note that there exists a significant gap between the objective forms of model pre-training and fine-tuning, resulting in a need for large amounts of labeled data to stimulate the visual grounding capability of VL-PTMs for downstream tasks. To address the challenge, we present Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (CPT, alternatively, Colorful Prompt Tuning), a novel paradigm for tuning VL-PTMs, which reformulates visual grounding into a fill-in-the-blank problem with color-based co-referential markers in image and text, maximally mitigating the gap. In this way, CPT enables strong few-shot and even zero-shot visual grounding capabilities of VL-PTMs. Comprehensive experimental results show that the prompt-tuned VL-PTMs outperform their fine-tuned counterparts by a large margin (e.g., 17.3% absolute accuracy improvement, and 73.8% relative standard deviation reduction on average with one shot in RefCOCO evaluation).

ICLR,2022,Hierarchical Cross Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations,"The rapid progress of self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly reduced the labeling cost in computer vision. The key idea of SSL is to learn invariant visual representations by maximizing the similarity between different views of the same input image. In most SSL methods, the representation invariant is measured by a contrastive loss which compares one of the network outputs after the projection head to its augmented version. Albeit being effective, this approach overlooks the information containing in the hidden layer of the projection head therefore could be sub-optimal. In this work,  we propose a novel approach termed Hierarchical Cross Contrastive Learning(HCCL) to further distill the information mismatched by the conventional contrastive loss. The HCCL uses a hierarchical projection head to project the raw representations of the backbone into multiple latent spaces and then compares latent features across different levels and different views. By cross-level contrastive learning, HCCL not only regulates invariant on multiple hidden levels but also crosses different levels, improving the generalization ability of the learned visual representations. As a simple and generic method, HCCL can be applied to different SSL frameworks. We validate the efficacy of HCCL under classification, detection, segmentation, and few-shot learning tasks. Extensive experimental results show that HCCL outperforms most previous methods in various benchmark datasets.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,Synchromesh: Reliable Code Generation from Pre-trained Language Models,"Large pre-trained language models have been used to generate code, providing a flexible interface for synthesizing programs from natural language specifications. However, they often violate syntactic and semantic rules of their output language, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose Synchromesh: a framework for substantially improving the reliability of pre-trained models for code generation. Synchromesh comprises two components. First, it retrieves few-shot examples from a training bank using Target Similarity Tuning (TST), a novel method for semantic example selection. TST learns to recognize utterances that describe similar target programs despite of differences in surface natural language features. Then, Synchromesh feeds the examples to a pre-trained language model and samples programs using Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD): a general framework for constraining the output to a set of valid programs in the target language. CSD leverages constraints on partial outputs to sample complete correct programs, and needs neither re-training nor fine-tuning of the language model. We evaluate our methods by synthesizing code from natural language descriptions using GPT-3 and Codex in three real-world languages: SQL queries, Vega-Lite visualizations and SMCalFlow programs. These domains showcase rich constraints that CSD is able to enforce, including syntax, scoping and typing rules. Across all languages, we observe complementary gains from CSD and TST in prediction accuracy and in effectively preventing parsing, type and run-time errors.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2022,How to Train Your MAML to Excel in Few-Shot Classification,"Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably one of the most popular meta-learning algorithms nowadays.
Nevertheless, its performance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms dedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how to train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that MAML needs a large number of gradient steps in its inner loop update, which contradicts its common usage in few-shot classification. Second, we find that MAML is sensitive to the class label assignments during meta-testing. Concretely, MAML meta-trains the initialization of an $N$-way classifier. These $N$ ways, during meta-testing, then have ""$N!$"" different permutations to be paired with a few-shot task of $N$ novel classes. We find that these permutations lead to a huge variance of accuracy, making MAML unstable in few-shot classification. Third, we investigate several approaches to make MAML permutation-invariant, among which meta-training a single vector to initialize all the $N$ weight vectors in the classification head performs the best. On benchmark datasets like MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name UNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms many recent few-shot classification algorithms, without sacrificing MAML's simplicity.",📊 评测基准与数据集

We provide theoretical analyses demonstrating that the proposed score is mathematically well-defined, and subsequently use the affinity score to propose a novel algorithm for the few-shot learning problem. In particular, using this score, we find relevant training data labels to the test data and leverage the discovered relevant data for episodically fine-tuning a few-shot model. Results on various few-shot benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by improving the classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods even when using smaller models.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Learning Prototype-oriented Set Representations for Meta-Learning,"Learning from set-structured data is a fundamental problem that has recently attracted increasing attention, where a series of summary networks are introduced to deal with the set input. In fact, many meta-learning problems can be treated as set-input tasks. Most existing summary networks aim to design different architectures for the input set in order to enforce permutation invariance. However, scant attention has been paid to the common cases where different sets in a meta distribution are closely related and share certain statistical properties. Viewing each set as a distribution over a set of global prototypes, this paper provides a novel prototype-oriented optimal transport (POT) framework to improve existing summary networks. To learn the distribution over the global prototypes, we minimize its regularized optimal transport distance to the set empirical distribution over data points, providing a natural unsupervised way to improve the summary network. Since our plug-and-play framework can be applied to many meta learning problems, we further instantiate it to the cases of few-shot classification and implicit meta generative modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the existing summary networks on learning more powerful summary statistics from sets and can be successfully integrated into metric-based few-shot classification and generative modeling applications, providing a promising tool for addressing set-input and meta-learning problems.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2022,Continuous-Time Meta-Learning with Forward Mode Differentiation,"Drawing inspiration from gradient-based meta-learning methods with infinitely small gradient steps, we introduce Continuous-Time Meta-Learning (COMLN), a meta-learning algorithm where adaptation follows the dynamics of a gradient vector field. Specifically, representations of the inputs are meta-learned such that a task-specific linear classifier is obtained as a solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Treating the learning process as an ODE offers the notable advantage that the length of the trajectory is now continuous, as opposed to a fixed and discrete number of gradient steps. As a consequence, we can optimize the amount of adaptation necessary to solve a new task using stochastic gradient descent, in addition to learning the initial conditions as is standard practice in gradient-based meta-learning. Importantly, in order to compute the exact meta-gradients required for the outer-loop updates, we  devise an efficient algorithm based on forward mode differentiation, whose memory requirements do not scale with the length of the learning trajectory, thus allowing longer adaptation in constant memory. We provide analytical guarantees for the stability of COMLN, we show empirically its efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage, and we illustrate its effectiveness on a range of few-shot image classification problems.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Task Conditioned Stochastic Subsampling,"Deep Learning algorithms are designed to operate on huge volumes of high dimensional data such as images.

In the first stage, we efficiently subsample \textit{candidate elements} using conditionally independent Bernoulli random variables, followed by conditionally dependent autoregressive subsampling of the candidate elements using Categorical random variables in the second stage. We apply our method to feature and instance selection and show that our method outperforms the relevant baselines under very low subsampling rates on many tasks including image classification, image reconstruction, function reconstruction and few-shot classification.  Additionally, for nonparametric models such as Neural Processes that require to leverage whole training data at inference time, we show that our method enhances the scalability of these models.

ICLR,2022,GANet: Glyph-Attention Network for Few-Shot Font Generation,"Font generation is a valuable but challenging task, it is time consuming and costly to design font libraries which cover all glyphs with various styles. The time and cost of such task will be greatly reduced if the complete font library can be generated from only a few custom samples. Inspired by font characteristics and global and local attention mechanism Wang et al. (2018), we propose a glyph-attention network (GANet) to tackle this problem. Firstly, a content encoder and a style encoder are trained to extract features as keys and values from a content glyph set and a style glyph set, respectively. Secondly, a query vector generated from a single glyph sample by the query encoder is applied to draw out proper features from the content and style (key, value) pairs via glyph-attention modules. Next, a decoder is used to recover a glyph from the queried features. Lastly, Adversarial losses Goodfellow et al.

ICLR,2022,Temporal Alignment Prediction for Supervised Representation Learning and Few-Shot Sequence Classification,"Explainable distances for sequence data depend on temporal alignment to tackle sequences with different lengths and local variances. Most sequence alignment methods infer the optimal alignment by solving an optimization problem under pre-defined feasible alignment constraints, which not only is time-consuming, but also makes end-to-end sequence learning intractable. In this paper, we propose a learnable sequence distance called Temporal Alignment Prediction (TAP). TAP employs a lightweight convolutional neural network to directly predict the optimal alignment between two sequences, so that only straightforward calculations are required and no optimization is involved in inference. TAP can be applied in different distance-based machine learning tasks. For supervised sequence representation learning, we show that TAP trained with various metric learning losses achieves completive performances with much faster inference speed. For few-shot action classification, we apply TAP as the distance measure in the metric learning-based episode-training paradigm. This simple strategy achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art few-shot action recognition methods.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Clustered Task-Aware Meta-Learning by Learning from Learning Paths,"To enable effective learning of new tasks with only few samples, meta-learning acquires common knowledge from the existing tasks with a globally shared meta-learner. To further address the problem of task heterogeneity, recent developments balance between customization and generalization by incorporating task clustering to generate the task-aware modulation to be applied on the global meta-learner. However, these methods learn task representation mostly from the features of input data, while the task-specific optimization process with respect to the base-learner model is often neglected. In this work, we propose a Clustered Task-Aware Meta-Learning (CTML) framework with task representation learned from its own learning path. We first conduct a rehearsed task learning from the common initialization, and collect a set of geometric quantities that adequately describes this learning path. By inputting this set of values into a meta path learner, we automatically abstract path representation optimized for the downstream clustering and modulation. To further save the computational cost incurred by the additional rehearsed learning, we devise a shortcut tunnel to directly map between the path and feature cluster assignments. Extensive experiments on two real-world application domains: few-shot image classification and cold-start recommendation demonstrate the superiority of CTML compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Language-driven Semantic Segmentation,"We present LSeg, a novel model for language-driven semantic image segmentation. LSeg uses a text encoder to compute embeddings of descriptive input labels (e.g., ``grass'' or ``building'') together with a transformer-based image encoder that computes dense per-pixel embeddings of the input image. The image encoder is trained with a contrastive objective to align pixel embeddings to the text embedding of the corresponding semantic class. The text embeddings provide a flexible label representation in which semantically similar labels map to similar regions in the embedding space (e.g., ``cat'' and ``furry''). This allows LSeg to generalize to previously unseen categories at test time, without retraining or even requiring a single additional training sample. We demonstrate that our approach achieves highly competitive zero-shot performance compared to existing zero- and few-shot semantic segmentation methods, and even matches the accuracy of traditional segmentation algorithms when a fixed label set is provided.

However, the zero-shot learning paradigm assumes that the set of attributes are known and fixed, which is a limitation if a test-time task depends on a previously irrelevant attribute. In this work we study rapid learning of attributes that are previously not labeled in the dataset. Compared to standard few-shot learning of semantic classes, learning new attributes imposes a stiffer challenge. We found that directly supervising the model with a set of training attributes does not generalize well on the test attributes, whereas self-supervised pre-training brings significant improvement. We further experimented with random splits of the attribute space and found that the predictability of attributes provides an informative estimate of a model's ability to generalize.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Few-Shot Backdoor Attacks on Visual Object Tracking,"Visual object tracking (VOT) has been widely adopted in mission-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance systems. In current practice, third-party resources such as datasets, backbone networks, and training platforms are frequently used to train high-performance VOT models. Whilst these resources bring certain convenience, they also introduce new security threats into VOT models. In this paper, we reveal such a threat where an adversary can easily implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by tempering with the training process. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) that optimizes two losses alternately: 1) a \emph{feature loss} defined in the hidden feature space, and 2) the standard \emph{tracking loss}. We show that, once the backdoor is embedded into the target model by our FSBA, it can trick the model to lose track of specific objects even when the \emph{trigger} only appears in one or a few frames. We examine our attack in both digital and physical-world settings and show that it can significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art VOT trackers. We also show that our attack is resistant to potential defenses, highlighting the vulnerability of VOT models to potential backdoor attacks.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,Online Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations and Categories,"Real world learning scenarios involve a nonstationary distribution of classes with sequential dependencies among the samples, in contrast to the standard machine learning formulation of drawing samples independently from a fixed, typically uniform distribution. Furthermore, real world interactions demand learning on-the-fly from few or no class labels. In this work, we propose an unsupervised model that simultaneously performs online visual representation learning and few-shot learning of new categories without relying on any class labels. Our model is a prototype-based memory network with a control component that determines when to form a new class prototype. We formulate it as an online Gaussian mixture model, where components are created online with only a single new example, and assignments do not have to be balanced, which permits an approximation to natural imbalanced distributions from uncurated raw data. Learning includes a contrastive loss that encourages different views of the same image to be assigned to the same prototype. The result is a mechanism that forms categorical representations of objects in nonstationary environments. Experiments show that our method can learn from an online stream of visual input data and is significantly better at category recognition compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods.",🎯 特定技术方法

First, we show that these two approaches have complementary features whose combination is beneficial. Then, we present partitioned batch ensembles, an efficient ensemble of sparse MoEs that takes the best of both classes of models. Extensive experiments on fine-tuned vision transformers demonstrate the accuracy, log-likelihood, few-shot learning, robustness, and uncertainty calibration improvements of our approach over several challenging baselines.

We highlight a bias introduced by this common practice: we prove that the pretrained NLM can model much stronger dependencies between text segments that appeared in the same training example, than it can between text segments that appeared in different training examples. This intuitive result has a twofold role. First, it formalizes the motivation behind a broad line of recent successful NLM training heuristics, proposed for the pretraining and fine-tuning stages, which do not necessarily appear related at first glance. Second, our result clearly indicates further improvements to be made in NLM pretraining for the benefit of Natural Language Understanding tasks. As an example, we propose ``kNN-Pretraining"": we show that including semantically related non-neighboring sentences in the same pretraining example yields improved sentence representations and open domain question answering abilities.	This theoretically motivated degree of freedom for pretraining example design indicates new training schemes for self-improving representations.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,Transferring Hierarchical Structure with Dual Meta Imitation Learning,"Hierarchical Imitation learning (HIL) is an effective way for robots to learn sub-skills from long-horizon unsegmented demonstrations. However, the learned hierarchical structure lacks the mechanism to transfer across multi-tasks or to new tasks, which makes them have to learn from scratch when facing a new situation. Transferring and reorganizing modular sub-skills require fast adaptation ability of the whole hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose Dual Meta Imitation Learning (DMIL), a hierarchical meta imitation learning method where the high-level network and sub-skills are iteratively meta-learned with model-agnostic meta-learning. DMIL uses the likelihood of state-action pairs from each sub-skill as the supervision for the high-level network adaptation, and use the adapted high-level network to determine different data set for each sub-skill adaptation. We theoretically prove the convergence of the iterative training process of DMIL and establish the connection between DMIL and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art few-shot imitation learning performance on the meta-world benchmark.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Vector-quantized Image Modeling with Improved VQGAN,"Pretraining language models with next-token prediction on massive text corpora has delivered phenomenal zero-shot, few-shot, transfer learning and multi-tasking capabilities on both generative and discriminative language tasks. Motivated by this success, we explore a Vector-quantized Image Modeling (VIM) approach that involves pretraining a Transformer to predict rasterized image tokens autoregressively. The discrete image tokens are encoded from a learned Vision-Transformer-based VQGAN (ViT-VQGAN). We first propose multiple improvements over vanilla VQGAN from architecture to codebook learning, yielding better efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. The improved ViT-VQGAN further improves vector-quantized image modeling tasks, including unconditional, class-conditioned image generation and unsupervised representation learning. When trained on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution, we achieve Inception Score (IS) of 175.1 and Fr'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 4.17, a dramatic improvement over the vanilla VQGAN, which obtains 70.6 and 17.04 for IS and FID, respectively. Based on ViT-VQGAN and unsupervised pretraining, we further evaluate the pretrained Transformer by averaging intermediate features, similar to Image GPT (iGPT). This ImageNet-pretrained VIM-L significantly beats iGPT-L on linear-probe accuracy from 60.3% to 73.2% for a similar model size. ViM-L also outperforms iGPT-XL which is trained with extra web image data and larger model size.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,On Hard Episodes in Meta-Learning,"Existing meta-learners primarily focus on improving the average task accuracy across multiple episodes. Different episodes, however, may vary in hardness and quality leading to a wide gap in the meta-learner's performance across episodes. Understanding this issue is particularly critical in industrial few-shot settings, where there is limited control over test episodes as they are typically uploaded by end-users. In this paper, we empirically analyse the behaviour of meta-learners on episodes of varying hardness across three standard benchmark datasets: CIFAR-FS, mini-ImageNet, and tiered-ImageNet. Surprisingly, we observe a wide gap in accuracy of around $50\%$ between the hardest and easiest episodes across all the standard benchmarks and meta-learners. We additionally investigate various properties of hard episodes and highlight their connection to catastrophic forgetting during meta-training.  To address the issue of sub-par performance on hard episodes, we investigate and benchmark different meta-training strategies based on adversarial training and curriculum learning.  We find that adversarial training strategies are much more powerful than curriculum learning in improving the prediction performance on hard episodes.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,Neural Variational Dropout Processes,"Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional dropout posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification. The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,Towards Better Understanding and Better Generalization of Low-shot Classification in Histology Images with Contrastive Learning,"Few-shot learning is an established topic in natural images for years, but few work is attended to histology images, which is of high clinical value since well-labeled datasets and rare abnormal samples are expensive to collect. Here, we facilitate the study of few-shot learning in histology images by setting up three cross-domain tasks that simulate real clinics problems. To enable label-efficient learning and better generalizability, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning (CL) with latent augmentation (LA) to build a few-shot system. CL learns useful representations without manual labels, while LA transfers semantic variations of the base dataset in an unsupervised way. These two components fully exploit unlabeled training data and can scale gracefully to other label-hungry problems. In experiments, we find i) models learned by CL generalize better than supervised learning for histology images in unseen classes, and ii) LA brings consistent gains over baselines. Prior studies of self-supervised learning mainly focus on ImageNet-like images, which only present a dominant object in their centers. Recent attention has been paid to images with multi-objects and multi-textures. Histology images are a natural choice for such a study. We show the superiority of CL over supervised learning in terms of generalization for such data and provide our empirical understanding for this observation. The findings in this work could contribute to understanding how the model generalizes in the context of both representation learning and histological image analysis. Code is available.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,Differentiable Prompt Makes Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners,"Large-scale pre-trained language models have contributed significantly to natural language processing by demonstrating remarkable abilities as few-shot learners. However, their effectiveness depends mainly on scaling the model parameters and prompt design, hindering their implementation in most real-world applications. This study proposes a novel pluggable, extensible, and efficient approach named DifferentiAble pRompT (DART), which can convert small language models into better few-shot learners. The main principle behind this approach involves reformulating potential natural language processing tasks into the task of a pre-trained language model and differentially optimizing the prompt template as well as the target label with backpropagation. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be: (i) Plugged to any pre-trained language models; (ii) Extended to widespread classification tasks. A comprehensive evaluation of standard NLP tasks demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves a better few-shot performance.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Few-shot Learning via Dirichlet Tessellation Ensemble,"Few-shot learning (FSL) is the process of rapid generalization from abundant base samples to inadequate novel samples. Despite extensive research in recent years, FSL is still not yet able to generate satisfactory solutions for a wide range of real-world applications. To confront this challenge, we study the FSL problem from a geometric point of view in this paper. One observation is that the widely embraced ProtoNet model is essentially a Voronoi Diagram (VD) in the feature space. We retrofit it by making use of a recent advance in computational geometry called Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD). Starting from the simplest nearest neighbor model, CIVD gradually incorporates cluster-to-point and then cluster-to-cluster relationships for space subdivision, which is used to improve the accuracy and robustness at multiple stages of FSL. Specifically, we use CIVD (1) to integrate parametric and nonparametric few-shot classifiers; (2) to combine feature representation and surrogate representation; (3) and to leverage feature-level, transformation-level, and geometry-level heterogeneities for a better ensemble. Our CIVD-based workflow enables us to achieve new state-of-the-art results on mini-ImageNet, CUB, and tiered-ImagenNet datasets, with ${\sim}2\%{-}5\%$ improvements upon the next best. To summarize, CIVD provides a mathematically elegant and geometrically interpretable framework that compensates for extreme data insufficiency, prevents overfitting, and allows for fast geometric ensemble for thousands of individual VD. These together make FSL stronger.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,Deep Point Cloud Reconstruction,"Point cloud obtained from 3D scanning is often sparse, noisy, and irregular. To cope with these issues, recent studies have been separately conducted to densify, denoise, and complete inaccurate point cloud. In this paper, we advocate that jointly solving these tasks leads to significant improvement for point cloud reconstruction. To this end, we propose a deep point cloud reconstruction network consisting of two stages: 1) a 3D sparse stacked-hourglass network as for the initial densification and denoising, 2) a refinement via transformers converting the discrete voxels into continuous 3D points. In particular, we further improve the performance of the transformers by a newly proposed module called amplified positional encoding. This module has been designed to differently amplify the magnitude of positional encoding vectors based on the points' distances for adaptive refinements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance among the recent studies in the ScanNet, ICL-NUIM, and ShapeNet datasets. Moreover, we underline the ability of our network to generalize toward real-world and unmet scenes.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2022,FROB: Few-shot ROBust Model for Classification with Out-of-Distribution Detection,"Nowadays, classification and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection in the few-shot setting remain challenging aims mainly due to rarity and the limited samples in the few-shot setting, and because of adversarial attacks. Accomplishing these aims is important for critical systems in safety, security, and defence. In parallel, OoD detection is challenging since deep neural network classifiers set high confidence to OoD samples away from the training data. To address such limitations, we propose the Few-shot ROBust (FROB) model for classification and few-shot OoD detection. We devise a methodology for improved robustness and reliable confidence prediction for few-shot OoD detection. We generate the support boundary of the normal class distribution and combine it with few-shot Outlier Exposure (OE). We propose a self-supervised learning few-shot confidence boundary methodology based on generative and discriminative models, including classification. The main contribution of FROB is the combination of the generated boundary in a self-supervised learning manner and the imposition of low confidence at this learned boundary. FROB implicitly generates strong adversarial samples on the boundary and forces samples from OoD, including our boundary, to be less confident by the classifier. FROB achieves generalization to unseen anomalies and adversarial attacks, with applicability to unknown, in the wild, test sets that do not correlate to the training datasets. To improve robustness, FROB redesigns and streamlines OE to work even for zero-shots. By including our learned boundary, FROB effectively reduces the threshold linked to the model’s few-shot robustness, and maintains the OoD performance approximately constant and independent of the number of few-shot samples. The few-shot robustness analysis evaluation of FROB on different image sets and on One-Class Classification (OCC) data shows that FROB achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance and outperforms benchmarks in terms of robustness to the outlier OoD few-shot sample population and variability.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2022,Meta-OLE: Meta-learned Orthogonal Low-Rank Embedding,"We introduce Meta-OLE, a new geometry-regularized method for fast adaptation to novel tasks in few-shot image classification. The proposed method learns to adapt for each few-shot classification task a feature space with simultaneous inter-class orthogonality and intra-class low-rankness. Specifically, a deep feature extractor is trained by explicitly imposing orthogonal low-rank subspace structures among features corresponding to different classes within a given task. To adapt to novel tasks with unseen categories, we further meta-learn a light-weight transformation to enhance the inter-class margins. As an additional benefit, this light-weight transformation lets us exploit the query data for label propagation from labeled to unlabeled data without any auxiliary network components. The explicitly geometry-regularized feature subspaces allow the classifiers on novel tasks to be inferred in a closed form, with an adaptive subspace truncation that selectively discards non-discriminative dimensions. We perform experiments on standard few-shot image classification tasks, and observe performance superior to state-of-the-art meta-learning methods.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Fast Adaptive Anomaly Detection,"The ability to detect anomaly has long been recognized as an inherent human ability, yet to date, practical AI solutions to mimic such capability have been lacking.This lack of progress can be attributed to several factors.  To begin with, the distribution of “abnormalities” is intractable.   Anything outside of a given normal population is by definition an anomaly. This explains why a large volume of workin this area has been dedicated to modeling the normal distribution of a given task followed by detecting deviations from it. This direction is however unsatisfying as it would require modeling the normal distribution of every task that comes along, which includes tedious data collection.  In this paper, we report our work aiming to handle these issues. To deal with the intractability of abnormal distribution, we leverage Energy Based Model (EBM). EBMs learn to associates low energies to correct values and higher energies to incorrect values.  As its core, the EBM em-ploys Langevin Dynamics (LD) in generating these incorrect samples based on an iterative optimization procedure, alleviating the intractable problem of modeling the world of anomalies.  Then, in order to avoid training an anomaly detector for every task, we utilize an adaptive sparse coding layer. Our intention is to design a plug and play feature that can be used to quickly update what is normal during inference time. Lastly, to avoid tedious data collection, this mentioned update of the sparse coding layer needs to be achievable with just a few shots. Here, we employ a meta learning scheme that simulates such a few shot setting during training. We support our findings with strong empirical evidence.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2022,Switch to Generalize: Domain-Switch Learning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification,"This paper considers few-shot learning under the cross-domain scenario. The cross-domain setting imposes a critical challenge, i.e., using very few (support) samples to generalize the already-learned model to a novel domain. We hold a hypothesis, i.e., if a deep model is capable to fast generalize itself to different domains (using very few samples) during training, it will maintain such domain generalization capacity for testing. It motivates us to propose a novel Domain-Switch Learning (DSL) framework. DSL embeds the cross-domain scenario into the training stage in a ``fast switching'' manner. Specifically, DSL uses a single domain for a training iteration and switches into another domain for the following iteration. During the switching, DSL enforces two constraints: 1) the deep model should not over-fit the domain in the current iteration and 2) the deep model should not forget the already-learned knowledge of other domains. These two constraints jointly promote fast generalization across different domains. Experimental results confirm that the cross-domain generalization capacity can be inherited from the training stage to the testing stage, validating our key hypothesis. Consequentially, DSL significantly improves cross-domain few-shot classification and sets up new state of the art.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2022,Zero-CL: Instance and Feature decorrelation for negative-free symmetric contrastive learning,"For self-supervised contrastive learning, models can easily collapse and generate trivial constant solutions. The issue has been mitigated by recent improvement on objective design, which however often requires square complexity either for the size of instances ($\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$) or feature dimensions ($\mathcal{O}(d)^2$). To prevent such collapse, we develop two novel methods by decorrelating on different dimensions on the instance embedding stacking matrix, i.e., \textbf{I}nstance-wise (ICL) and \textbf{F}eature-wise (FCL) \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning. The proposed two methods (FCL, ICL) can be combined synthetically, called Zero-CL, where ``Zero'' means negative samples are \textbf{zero} relevant, which allows Zero-CL to completely discard negative pairs i.e., with \textbf{zero} negative samples. Compared with previous methods, Zero-CL mainly enjoys three advantages: 1) Negative free in symmetric architecture. 2) By whitening transformation, the correlation of the different features is equal to zero, alleviating information redundancy. 3) Zero-CL remains original information to a great extent after transformation, which improves the accuracy against other whitening transformation techniques. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet show that Zero-CL outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art symmetric contrastive learning methods.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2022,Transformers Can Do Bayesian Inference,"Currently, it is hard to reap the benefits of deep learning for Bayesian methods, which allow the explicit specification of prior knowledge and accurately capture model uncertainty. We present Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs). PFNs leverage large-scale machine learning techniques to approximate a large set of posteriors. The only requirement for PFNs to work is the ability to sample from a prior distribution over supervised learning tasks (or functions). Our method restates the objective of posterior approximation as a supervised classification problem with a set-valued input: it repeatedly draws a task (or function) from the prior, draws a set of data points and their labels from it, masks one of the labels and learns to make probabilistic predictions for it based on the set-valued input of the rest of the data points. Presented with a set of samples from a new supervised learning task as input, PFNs make probabilistic predictions for arbitrary other data points in a single forward propagation, having learned to approximate Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that PFNs can near-perfectly mimic Gaussian processes and also enable efficient Bayesian inference for intractable problems, with over 200-fold speedups in multiple setups compared to current methods. We obtain strong results in very diverse areas such as Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural networks, classification for small tabular data sets, and few-shot image classification, demonstrating the generality of PFNs.

ICLR,2022,Robust Cross-Modal Semi-supervised Few Shot Learning,"Semi-supervised learning has been successfully applied to few-shot
learning (FSL) due to its capability of leveraging the information
of limited labeled data and massive unlabeled data. However, in many
realistic applications, the query and support sets provided for FSL
are potentially noisy or unreadable where the noise exists in both
corrupted labels and outliers. Motivated by that, we propose to
employ a robust cross-modal semi-supervised few-shot learning
(RCFSL) based on Bayesian deep learning. By placing the uncertainty
prior on top of the parameters of infinite Gaussian mixture model
for noisy input, multi-modality information from image and text data
are integrated into a robust heterogenous variational autoencoder.
Subsequently, a robust divergence measure is employed to further
enhance the robustness, where a novel variational lower bound is
derived and optimized to infer the network parameters. Finally, a robust semi-supervised
generative adversarial network is employed to generate robust
features to compensate data sparsity in few shot learning and a
joint optimization is applied for training and inference. Our
approach is more parameter-efficient, scalable and adaptable
compared to previous approaches. Superior performances over the

ICLR,2022,Stochastic Deep Networks with Linear Competing Units for Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning,"This work addresses meta-learning (ML) by considering deep networks with stochastic local winner-takes-all (LWTA) activations. This type of network units result in sparse representations from each model layer, as the units are organized into blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The main operating principle of the introduced units lies on stochastic arguments, as the network performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the winner. Therefore, the proposed networks are explicitly designed to extract input data representations of sparse stochastic nature, as opposed to the currently standard deterministic representation paradigm. We posit that these modeling arguments, inspired from Bayesian statistics, allow for more robust modeling when uncertainty is high due to the limited availability of task-related training data; this is exactly the case with ML, which is the focus of this work. At training time, we rely on the reparameterization trick for Discrete distributions to perform reliable training via Monte-Carlo sampling. At inference time, we rely on Bayesian Model Averaging, which effectively averages over a number of sampled representations. As we experimentally show, our approach produces state-of-the-art predictive accuracy on standard few-shot image classification benchmarks; this is achieved without compromising computational efficiency.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全

To that end, we utilize a question-answering retrieval architecture and adopt a two stages training schema with batch contrastive loss. In the pre-training stage, we improve query representations through self-supervised training. Then, in the fine-tuning stage, we increase contextualized token-level similarity scores between queries and answers from the same intent.

ICLR,2023,Few-Shot Domain Adaptation For End-to-End Communication,"The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate. Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples, it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot) domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks. Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN), and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples~\footnote{Code for our work: \url{https://github.com/jayaram-r/domain-adaptation-autoencoder}}.",⚡ 效率优化
ICLR,2023,Leveraging Large Language Models for Multiple Choice Question Answering,"While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have achieved impressive results on multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks in the zero, one, and few-shot settings, they generally lag behind the MCQA state of the art (SOTA). MCQA tasks have traditionally been presented to LLMs like cloze tasks. An LLM is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g., “A”) associated with its chosen answer option. This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective, the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them. The LLM needs what we term multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a model with high MCSB ability performs much better with the natural approach than with the traditional approach across 20 diverse datasets and largely closes the gap with the SOTA, suggesting that the MCQA ability of LLMs has been previously underestimated.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2023,Automatically Answering and Generating Machine Learning Final Exams,"Can a machine learn machine learning? We propose to answer this question using the same criteria we use to answer a similar question: can a human learn machine learning? We automatically answer final exams in MIT's recent large machine learning course and generate new questions at a human level. Recently, program synthesis and few-shot learning solved university-level problem set questions in mathematics and STEM courses at a human level. In this work, we solve questions from final exams that differ from problem sets in several ways: the questions are longer, have multiple parts, are more complicated, and span a broader set of topics. We provide a new dataset and benchmark of questions from machine learning final exams and code for automatically answering these questions and generating new questions. To make our dataset a reproducible benchmark, we use automatic checkers for multiple choice questions, questions with numeric answers, and questions with expression answers, and evaluate a large free language model, Meta’s OPT, and compare the results with Open AI’s GPT-3 and Codex. A student survey comparing the quality, appropriateness, and difficulty of machine-generated questions with human-written questions shows that across multiple aspects, machine-generated questions are indistinguishable from human-generated questions and are suitable for final exams. We perform ablation studies comparing zero-shot learning with few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, GPT-3 and OPT pre-trained on text and Codex fine-tuned on code on a range of machine learning topics and find that few-shot learning methods perform best.

ICLR,2023,UL2: Unifying Language Learning Paradigms,"Existing pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization.

ICLR,2023,STUNT: Few-shot Tabular Learning with Self-generated Tasks from Unlabeled Tables,"Learning with few labeled tabular samples is often an essential requirement for industrial machine learning applications as varieties of tabular data suffer from high annotation costs or have difficulties in collecting new samples for novel tasks. Despite the utter importance, such a problem is quite under-explored in the field of tabular learning, and existing few-shot learning schemes from other domains are not straightforward to apply, mainly due to the heterogeneous characteristics of tabular data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for few-shot semi-supervised tabular learning, coined Self-generated Tasks from UNlabeled Tables (STUNT). Our key idea is to self-generate diverse few-shot tasks by treating randomly chosen columns as a target label. We then employ a meta-learning scheme to learn generalizable knowledge with the constructed tasks. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised validation scheme for hyperparameter search (and early stopping) by generating a pseudo-validation set using STUNT from unlabeled data.

However, a question remains: what data and method should be used for pre-training? We study the effect of the pre-training distribution on transfer learning in the context of image classification. Through controlled experiments, we find that the pre-training dataset is initially important for low-shot transfer. However, the differences between distributions is diminished as more data is made available for fine-tuning. Still, fine-tuning outperforms training from scratch. We also investigate dataset size and observe that larger pre-training datasets lead to better accuracy, however, the absolute accuracy difference is largest in the few-shot regime. Beyond data, we study the effect of the pre-training method, language-image contrastive vs. image-image contrastive, finding that the latter usually leads to better transfer accuracy",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Adaptive IMLE for Few-shot Image Synthesis,"Despite their success on large datasets, GANs have been difficult to apply in the few-shot setting, where only a limited number of training examples are provided. Due to mode collapse, GANs tend to ignore some training examples, causing overfitting to a subset of the training dataset, which is small to begin with. A recent method called Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) is an alternative to GAN that tries to address this issue. It uses the same kind of generators as GANs but trains it with a different objective that encourages mode coverage. However, the theoretical guarantees of IMLE hold under restrictive conditions, such as the requirement for the optimal likelihood at all data points to be the same. In this paper, we present a more generalized formulation of IMLE which includes the original formulation as a special case, and we prove that the theoretical guarantees hold under weaker conditions. Using this generalized formulation, we further derive a new algorithm, which we dub Adaptive IMLE, which can adapt to the varying difficulty of different training examples.

ICLR,2023,Ask Me Anything: A simple strategy for prompting language models,"Large language models (LLMs) transfer well to new tasks out-of-the-box simply given a natural language prompt that demonstrates how to perform the task and no additional training. Prompting is a brittle process wherein small modifications to the prompt can cause large variations in the model predictions, and therefore significant effort is dedicated towards designing a painstakingly crafted ""perfect prompt"" for a task. To mitigate the high degree of effort, we instead ask whether collecting multiple decent, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high quality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed method, Ask Me Anything (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the effective prompt formats, finding question-answering (QA) prompts, which encourage open-ended generation (""Who went to the park?"") tend to outperform those that restrict the model outputs (""John went to the park. True or False?""). AMA recursively uses the LLM to transform task inputs to the effective QA format. AM generates multiple questions per input and applies these prompts to collect several noisy ""votes"" for the input's true label. We find the prompts have varying accuracies and dependencies and thus propose to use weak supervision, a procedure for combining the noisy predictions, to produce the final predictions. We evaluate AMA across open-source model families (EleutherAI, BLOOM, OPT, and T0) and sizes (125M-175B parameters), demonstrating an average performance lift of 10.2\% over the few-shot baseline. This simple strategy enables the open-source GPT-J-6B model to match and exceed the performance of few-shot GPT3-175B  on 15 of 20 popular benchmarks.

ICLR,2023,Unsupervised Meta-learning via Few-shot Pseudo-supervised Contrastive Learning,"Unsupervised meta-learning aims to learn generalizable knowledge across a distribution of tasks constructed from unlabeled data. Here, the main challenge is how to construct diverse tasks for meta-learning without label information; recent works have proposed to create, e.g., pseudo-labeling via pretrained representations or creating synthetic samples via generative models. However, such a task construction strategy is fundamentally limited due to heavy reliance on the immutable pseudo-labels during meta-learning and the quality of the representations or the generated samples. To overcome the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised meta-learning framework, coined Pseudo-supervised Contrast (PsCo), for few-shot classification. We are inspired by the recent self-supervised learning literature; PsCo utilizes a momentum network and a queue of previous batches to improve pseudo-labeling and construct diverse tasks in a progressive manner. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PsCo outperforms existing unsupervised meta-learning methods under various in-domain and cross-domain few-shot classification benchmarks. We also validate that PsCo is easily scalable to a large-scale benchmark, while recent prior-art meta-schemes are not.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2023,PromptBoosting: Black-Box Text Classification with Ten Forward Passes,"We describe PromptBoosting, a query-efficient procedure for building a text classifier from a neural language model (LM) without access to the LM’s parameters, gradients, or hidden representations. This form of “black-box” classifier training has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale LMs grows. But existing black-box LM classifier learning approaches are themselves computationally inefficient, typically specializing LMs to the target task by searching in a large space of (discrete or continuous) prompts using zeroth-order optimization methods. Instead of directly optimizing in prompt space, PromptBoosting obtains a small pool of prompts via a gradient-free approach and then constructs a large pool of weak learners by pairing these prompts with different elements of the LM’s output distribution. These weak learners are then ensembled using the AdaBoost algorithm. The entire learning process requires only a small number of forward passes and no backward pass. Experiments show that PromptBoosting achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple black-box few-shot classification tasks, and matches or outperforms full fine-tuning in both few-shot and standard learning paradigms, while training 10x faster than existing black-box methods.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Teaching Algorithmic Reasoning via In-context Learning,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing in-context learning capabilities through scaling up model and data size. Despite this progress, LLMs are still unable to solve algorithmic reasoning problems. While providing a rationale with the final answer has led to further improvements in multi-step reasoning problems, Anil et al. 2022 showed that even simple algorithmic reasoning tasks such as parity are far from solved. In this work, we identify and study four key stages for successfully teaching algorithmic reasoning to LLMs: (1) formulating algorithms as skills, (2) teaching multiple skills simultaneously (skill accumulation), (3) teaching how to combine skills (skill composition) and (4) teaching how to use skills as tools. We show that it is possible to teach algorithmic reasoning to LLMs via in-context learning, which we refer to as Algorithmic Prompting. We evaluate our approach on a variety of arithmetic and quantitative reasoning tasks, and demonstrate significant boosts in performance over existing prompting techniques. In particular, for long parity, addition, multiplication and subtraction and parity tasks, we achieve an error reduction of approximately 10x, 9x, 5x and 2x respectively compared to the best available baselines.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2023,Large Language Models are Human-Level Prompt Engineers,"By conditioning on natural language instructions, large language models (LLMs) have displayed impressive capabilities as general-purpose computers. However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the ""program,"" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 21/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2023,​​What learning algorithm is in-context learning? Investigations with linear models,"Neural sequence models, especially transformers, exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning. They can construct new predictors from sequences of labeled examples $(x, f(x))$ presented in the input without further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding context-specific parametric models in their hidden representations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a model problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form computation of regression parameters. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary. Third, we present preliminary evidence that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners' late layers encode weight vectors and moment matrices.  These results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may work by rediscovering standard estimation algorithms.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Spotlight: Mobile UI Understanding using Vision-Language Models with a Focus,"Mobile UI understanding is important for enabling various interaction tasks such as UI automation and accessibility. Previous mobile UI modeling often depends on the view hierarchy information of a screen, which directly provides the structural data of the UI, with the hope to bypass challenging tasks of visual modeling from screen pixels. However, view hierarchies are not always available, and are often corrupted with missing object descriptions or misaligned structure information. As a result, despite the use of view hierarchies could offer short-term gains, it may ultimately hinder the applicability and performance of the model. In this paper, we propose Spotlight, a vision-only approach for mobile UI understanding. Specifically, we enhance a vision-language model that only takes the screenshot of the UI and a region of interest on the screen---the focus---as the input. This general architecture of Spotlight is easily scalable and capable of performing a range of UI modeling tasks. Our experiments show that our model establishes SoTA results on several representative UI tasks and outperforms previous methods that use both screenshots and view hierarchies as inputs. Furthermore, we explore multi-task learning and few-shot prompting capacities of the proposed models, demonstrating promising results in the multi-task learning direction.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Data-Efficient Finetuning Using Cross-Task Nearest Neighbors,"Language models trained on massive prompted multitask datasets like T0 (Sanh et al., 2021) or FLAN (Wei et al., 2021) can generalize to tasks unseen during training. We show that training on a carefully chosen subset of instances can outperform training on all available data on a variety of datasets. We assume access to a small number (250-1000) of unlabeled target task instances, select their nearest neighbors from a pool of multitask data, and use the retrieved data to train target task specific models. Our method is more data-efficient than training a single multitask model, while still outperforming it by large margins. We evaluate across a diverse set of tasks not in the multitask pool we retrieve from, including those used to evaluate T0 and in addition, more complex tasks including legal and scientific document QA. We retrieve small subsets of P3 (the collection of prompted datasets from which T0’s training data was sampled) and finetune T5 models that outperform the 3-billion parameter variant of T0 (T0-3B) by 8-30% on 11 out of 12 evaluation datasets while using at most 2% of the data used to train T0-3B. These models also provide a better initialization than T0-3B for few-shot finetuning on target-task data, as shown by a 3-23% relative improvement over few-shot finetuned T0-3B models on 8 datasets.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Decomposed Prompting: A Modular Approach for Solving Complex Tasks,"Few-shot prompting is a surprisingly powerful way to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve various tasks. However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired.
We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

ICLR,2023,Forgetful causal masking makes causal language models better zero-shot learners,"Large language models (LLM) trained using the next-token-prediction objective, such as GPT3 and PaLM, have revolutionized natural language processing in recent years by showing impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose a simple technique that significantly boosts the performance of LLMs without adding computational cost. Our key observation is that, by performing the next token prediction task with randomly selected past tokens masked out, we can improve the quality of the learned representations for downstream language understanding tasks. We hypothesize that randomly masking past tokens prevents over-attending to recent tokens and encourages attention to tokens in the distant past. By randomly masking input tokens in the PaLM model, we show that we can significantly improve PaLM's zero-shot performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark from 55.7 to 59.2. Experimental results show that FCM also improves PaLM's zero- and few-shot performance on a diverse suite of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, natural language inference and cloze completion. Moreover, we show that our technique also helps representation learning, significantly improving PaLM's finetuning results on SuperGLUE.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Binding Language Models in Symbolic Languages,"Though end-to-end neural approaches have recently been dominating NLP tasks in both performance and ease-of-use, they lack interpretability and robustness. We propose Binder, a training-free neural-symbolic framework that maps the task input to a program, which (1) allows binding a unified API of language model (LM) functionalities to a programming language (e.g., SQL, Python) to extend its grammar coverage and thus tackle more diverse questions, (2) adopts an LM as both the program parser and the underlying model called by the API during execution, and (3) requires only a few in-context exemplar annotations. Specifically, we employ GPT-3 Codex as the LM. In the parsing stage, with only a few in-context exemplars, Codex is able to identify the part of the task input that cannot be answerable by the original programming language, correctly generate API calls to prompt Codex to solve the unanswerable part, and identify where to place the API calls while being compatible with the original grammar. In the execution stage, Codex can perform versatile functionalities (e.g., commonsense QA, information extraction) given proper prompts in the API calls. Binder achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging. Note that previous best systems are all finetuned on tens of thousands of task-specific samples, while Binder only uses dozens of annotations as in-context exemplars without any training.

ICLR,2023,Progressive Mix-Up for Few-Shot Supervised Multi-Source Domain Transfer,"This paper targets at a new and challenging setting of knowledge transfer from multiple source domains to a single target domain, where target data is few shot or even one shot with label. Traditional domain generalization or adaptation methods cannot directly work since there is no sufficient target domain distribution serving as the transfer object. The multi-source setting further prevents the transfer task as excessive domain gap introduced from all the source domains. To tackle this problem, we newly propose a progressive mix-up (P-Mixup) mechanism to introduce an intermediate mix-up domain, pushing both the source domains and the few-shot target domain aligned to this mix-up domain. Further by enforcing the mix-up domain to progressively move towards the source domains, we achieve the domain transfer from multi-source domains to the single one-shot target domain. Our P-Mixup is different from traditional mix-up that ours is with a progressive and adaptive mix-up ratio, following the curriculum learning spirit to better align the source and target domains. Moreover, our P-Mixup combines both pixel-level and feature-level mix-up to better enrich the data diversity. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our P-Mixup significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., 6.0\% and 6.8\% improvements on Office-Home and DomainNet.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2023,Promptagator: Few-shot Dense Retrieval From 8 Examples,"Much recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer from one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other retrieval tasks where supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to generalize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval problems, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To address this, we introduce Prompt-based Query Generation forRetrieval (Promptagator): for each task, we feed the few-shot examples to a large language model (LLM) and prompt it to behave as a task-specific query generator. Using this, we can synthetically generate a large number of relevant queries for any document, yielding abundant data for training task-specific retrievers --- with no reliance on traditional resources such as Natural Questions (Kwiatkowskiet al., 2019) or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016). Surprisingly, Promptagator with only 8 annotated examples enables efficient dual encoder retrievers to outperform computationally more expensive models trained on MS MARCO such as ColBERT v2 (Santhanam et al., 2022) by more than 1.2 points nDCG@10 on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 points nDCG@10 improvement. Our studies show that synthetic query generation can be far more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of task-specific knowledge is given.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Few-Shot Incremental Learning Using HyperTransformers,"Incremental few-shot learning methods make it possible to learn without forgetting from multiple few-shot tasks arriving sequentially. In this work we approach this problem using the recently published HyperTransformer (HT): a hypernetwork that generates task-specific CNN weights directly from the support set. We propose to re-use these generated weights as an input to the HT for the next task of the continual-learning sequence. Thus, the HT uses the weights themselves as the representation of the previously learned tasks. This approach is different from most continual learning algorithms that typically rely on using replay buffers, weight regularization or task-dependent architectural changes. Instead, we show that the HT works akin to a recurrent model, relying on the weights from the previous task and a support set from a new task. We demonstrate that a single HT equipped with a prototypical loss is capable of learning and retaining knowledge about past tasks for two continual learning scenarios: incremental-task learning and incremental-class learning.",📊 评测基准与数据集

We find that the ability to solve MGSM problems via chain-of-thought prompting emerges with increasing model scale, and that models have strikingly strong multilingual reasoning abilities, even in underrepresented languages such as Bengali and Swahili. Finally, we show that multilingual reasoning abilities of language models extend to other tasks such as commonsense reasoning and word-in-context semantic judgment.

ICLR,2023,Reward Design with Language Models,"Reward design in reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging since specifying human notions of desired behavior may be difficult via reward functions or require many expert demonstrations. Can we instead cheaply design rewards using a natural language interface? This paper explores how to simplify reward design by using a large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3 as a proxy reward function, where the user provides a textual prompt containing a few examples (few-shot) or a description (zero-shot) of desired behavior. Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM evaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and the DealOrNoDeal negotiation task. In all three tasks, we show that RL agents trained with our framework are well-aligned with the user's objectives and outperforms RL agents trained with reward functions learned via supervised learning.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Towards Efficient Gradient-Based Meta-Learning in Heterogenous Environments,"A challenging problem for machine learning is few-shot learning, as its models usually require many training samples. Since meta-learning models have strong fine-tuning capabilities for the distribution of tasks, many of them have been applied to few-shot learning. Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most popular ones. Recent studies showed that MAML-trained models tend to reuse learned features and do not perform strong adaption, especially in the earlier layers. This paper presents an in-detail analysis of this phenomenon by analyzing MAML's components of different variants. Our results show an interesting relationship between the importance of fine-tuning earlier layers and the difference in the distribution between training and testing. As a result, we determine a fundamental weakness of existing MAML variants when the task distribution is heterogeneous, e.g., the numbers of classes do not match during testing and training. We propose a novel nonparametric version of MAML that overcomes these issues while still being able to perform cross-domain adaption.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Universal Few-shot Learning of Dense Prediction Tasks with Visual Token Matching,"Dense prediction tasks are a fundamental class of problems in computer vision. As supervised methods suffer from high pixel-wise labeling cost, a few-shot learning solution that can learn any dense task from a few labeled images is desired. Yet, current few-shot learning methods target a restricted set of tasks such as semantic segmentation, presumably due to challenges in designing a general and unified model that is able to flexibly and efficiently adapt to arbitrary tasks of unseen semantics. We propose Visual Token Matching (VTM), a universal few-shot learner for arbitrary dense prediction tasks. It employs non-parametric matching on patch-level embedded tokens of images and labels that encapsulates all tasks. Also, VTM flexibly adapts to any task with a tiny amount of task-specific parameters that modulate the matching algorithm. We implement VTM as a powerful hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture involving ViT backbones where token matching is performed at multiple feature hierarchies. We experiment VTM on a challenging variant of Taskonomy dataset and observe that it robustly few-shot learns various unseen dense prediction tasks. Surprisingly, it is competitive with fully supervised baselines using only 10 labeled examples of novel tasks ($0.004\%$ of full supervision) and sometimes outperforms using $0.1\%$ of full supervision.

ICLR,2023,Improving Aspect Ratio Distribution Fairness in Detector Pretraining via Cooperating RPN’s,"Region proposal networks (RPN) are a key component of modern object detectors. An RPN identifies image boxes likely to contain objects, and so worth further investigation.  An RPN false negative is unrecoverable, so the performance of an object detector can be significantly affected by RPN behavior, particularly in low-data regimes. The RPN for a few shot detector is trained on base classes.  Our experiments demonstrate that, if the distribution of box aspect ratios for base classes is different from that for novel classes, errors caused by RPN failure to propose a good box become significant.  This is predictable: for example, an RPN trained on base classes that are mostly square will tend to miss short wide boxes.  It has not been noticed to date because the (relatively few) standard base/novel class splits on current datasets do not display this effect. But changing the base/novel split highlights the problem. We describe datasets where the distribution shift is severe using PASCAL VOC, COCO, and LVIS datasets.
We show that the effect can be mitigated by training multiple distinct but cooperating specialized RPNs.  Each specializes in a different aspect ratio, but cooperation constraints reduce the extent to which the RPNs are tuned. This means that if a box is missed by one RPN, it has a good chance of being picked up by another.  Experimental evaluation confirms this approach results in substantial improvements in performance on the ARShift benchmarks, while remaining comparable to SOTA on conventional splits.  Our approach applies to any few-shot detector and consistently improves performance of detectors.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Analogy-Forming Transformers for Few-Shot 3D Parsing,"We present Analogical Networks, a model that segments 3D object scenes with analogical reasoning: instead of mapping a scene to part segments directly, our model first retrieves related scenes from memory and their corresponding part structures, and then predicts analogous part structures in the input object 3D point cloud, via an end-to-end learnable modulation mechanism. By conditioning on more than one retrieved memories, compositions of structures are predicted, that mix and match parts across the retrieved memories. One-shot, few-shot or many-shot learning are treated uniformly in Analogical Networks, by conditioning on the appropriate set of memories, whether taken from a single, few or many memory exemplars, and inferring analogous parses. We show Analogical Networks are competitive with state-of-the-art 3D segmentation transformer in many-shot settings and outperform them and existing paradigms of meta-learning and few-shot learning in few-shot scenarios.

In this work, we provide evidence that disentangled representations coupled with sparse base-predictors improve generalization. In the context of multi-task learning, we prove a new identifiability result that provides conditions under which maximally sparse base-predictors yield disentangled representations. Motivated by this theoretical result, we propose a practical approach to learn disentangled representations based on a sparsity-promoting bi-level optimization problem. Finally, we explore a meta-learning version of this algorithm based on group Lasso multiclass SVM base-predictors, for which we derive a tractable dual formulation. It obtains competitive results on standard few-shot classification benchmarks, while each task is using only a fraction of the learned representations.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models,"While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.

ICLR,2023,Prompt Tuning with Prompt-aligned Gradient for Vision-Language Models,"Thanks to the large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, we can craft a zero-shot classifier by ``prompt'', e.g., using the model provided similarity measure between an image and the prompt sentence ``$\texttt{a photo of a [CLASS]}$'', as the confidence score of predicting the image is ``$\texttt{[CLASS]}$''. Therefore, prompt shows a great potential for fast adapting the VLMs to downstream tasks if we fine-tune the prompt-based similarity measure. However, we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning may not only undermine the prompt's inherent prediction for the task-related classes, but also for other classes in the VLM vocabulary. Existing methods still address this problem by using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompt. We present Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed $\texttt{ProGrad}$, to prevent prompt tuning from forgetting the the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, $\texttt{ProGrad}$ only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the ``general direction'', which is represented as the gradient of the KL loss of the pre-defined prompt prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the stronger few-shot generalization ability of $\texttt{ProGrad}$ over state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods. Codes are in Appendix.",📊 评测基准与数据集

To achieve this, we design a novel action space that allows flexible editing of the initial prompts covering a wide set of commonly-used components like instructions, few-shot exemplars, and verbalizers. The proposed method achieves significant gains compared with recent SoTA approaches like prompt tuning, AutoPrompt, and RLPrompt, across a variety of tasks including sentiment analysis, topic classification, natural language inference, and reading comprehension.

ICLR,2023,Understanding Train-Validation Split in Meta-Learning with Neural Networks,"The goal of meta-learning is to learn a good prior model from a collection of tasks such that the learned prior is able to adapt quickly to new tasks without accessing many data from the new tasks. A common practice in meta-learning is to perform a train-validation split on each task, where the training set is used for adapting the model parameter to that specific task and the validation set is used for learning a prior model that is shared across all tasks. Despite its success and popularity in multitask learning and few-shot learning, the understanding of the train-validation split is still limited, especially when the neural network models are used. In this paper, we study the benefit of train-validation split for classification problems with neural network models trained by gradient descent. We prove that the train-validation split is necessary to learn a good prior model when the noise in the training sample is large, while the train-train method fails. We validate our theory by conducting experiment on both synthetic and real datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work towards the theoretical understanding of train-validation split in meta-learning with neural networks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Few-shot Backdoor Attacks via Neural Tangent Kernels,"In a backdoor attack, an attacker injects corrupted examples into the training set. The goal of the attacker is to cause the final trained model to predict the attacker's desired target label when a predefined trigger is added to test inputs. Central to these attacks is the trade-off between the success rate of the attack and the number of corrupted training examples injected. We pose this attack as a novel bilevel optimization problem: construct strong poison examples that maximize the attack success rate of the trained model. We use neural tangent kernels to approximate the training dynamics of the model being attacked and automatically learn strong poison examples. We experiment on subclasses of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with WideResNet-34 and ConvNeXt architectures on periodic and patch trigger attacks and show that NTBA-designed poisoned examples achieve, for example, an attack success rate of  90% with ten times smaller number of poison examples injected compared to the baseline. We provided an interpretation of the NTBA-designed attacks using the analysis of kernel linear regression. We further demonstrate a vulnerability in overparametrized deep neural networks, which is revealed by the shape of the neural tangent kernel.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2023,Large language models are not zero-shot communicators,"The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has drawn heavy attention and investment in their use as conversational and embodied systems. Despite widespread use of LLMs as conversational agents, evaluations of performance fail to capture a crucial aspect of communication: interpreting language in context. Humans interpret language using beliefs, prior knowledge about the world, and more. For example, we intuitively understand the response ""I wore gloves"" to the question ""Did you leave fingerprints?"" as meaning ""No"". To investigate whether LLMs have the ability to make this type of inference, known as an implicature, we design a simple task and evaluate a set of models. We find that despite only evaluating on utterances that require a binary inference (yes or no), most perform close to random. Models adapted to be ""aligned with human intent"" via reinforcement learning perform much better, but still leave a significant gap with human performance. This gap is even more pronounced for context-heavy utterances.

ICLR,2023,Meta-Learning via Classifier(-free) Guidance,"State-of-the-art meta-learning techniques do not optimize for zero-shot adaptation to unseen tasks, a setting in which humans excel. On the contrary, meta-learning algorithms learn hyperparameters and weight initializations that explicitly optimize for few-shot learning performance. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in generative modeling and language-conditioned image synthesis to propose meta-learning techniques that use natural language guidance to achieve higher zero-shot performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We do so by recasting the meta-learning problem as a multi-modal generative modeling problem: given a task, we consider its adapted neural network weights and its natural language description as equivalent multi-modal task representations. We first train an unconditional generative hypernetwork model to produce neural network weights; then we train a second ""guidance"" model that, given a natural language task description, traverses the hypernetwork latent space to find high-performance task-adapted weights in a zero-shot manner. We explore two alternative approaches for latent space guidance: ""HyperCLIP""-based classifier guidance and a conditional Hypernetwork Latent Diffusion Model (""HyperLDM""), which we show to benefit from the classifier-free guidance technique common in image generation. Finally, we demonstrate that our approaches outperform existing meta-learning methods with zero-shot learning experiments on our Meta-VQA dataset, which we specifically constructed to reflect the multi-modal meta-learning setting.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Meta Learning to Bridge Vision and Language Models for Multimodal Few-Shot Learning,"Multimodal few-shot learning is challenging due to the large domain gap between vision and language modalities. Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples.

Existing methods heavily rely on hand-crafted augmentations, which are not easily adapted to new domains. To explore a general-purpose or domain-agnostic siamese network, we investigate using masking as augmentations in siamese networks. Recently, masking for siamese networks has only been shown useful with transformer architectures, e.g. MSN and data2vec. In this work, we identify the underlying problems of masking for siamese networks with arbitrary backbones, including ConvNets. We propose an effective and general-purpose masking strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness on various siamese network frameworks. Our method generally improves siamese networks' performances in the few-shot image classification, and object detection tasks.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2023,Generating Sequences by Learning to Self-Correct,"Sequence generation applications require satisfying semantic constraints, such as ensuring that programs are correct, using certain keywords, or avoiding undesirable content. Language models, whether fine-tuned or prompted with few-shot demonstrations, frequently violate these constraints, and lack a mechanism to iteratively revise their outputs. Moreover, some powerful language models are of extreme scale or inaccessible, making it inefficient, if not infeasible, to update their parameters for task-specific adaptation. We present Self-Correction, an approach that decouples an imperfect base generator (an off-the-shelf language model or supervised sequence-to-sequence model) from a separate corrector that learns to iteratively correct imperfect generations. To train the corrector, we propose an online training procedure that can use either scalar or natural language feedback on intermediate imperfect generations. We show that  Self-Correction improves upon the base generator in three diverse generation tasks - mathematical program synthesis, lexically-constrained generation, and toxicity control - even when the corrector is much smaller than the base generator.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2023,$k$NN Prompting: Beyond-Context Learning with Calibration-Free Nearest Neighbor Inference,"In-Context Learning (ICL), which formulates target tasks as prompt completion conditioned on in-context demonstrations, has become the prevailing utilization of LLMs. In this paper, we first disclose an actual predicament for this typical usage that it can not scale up with training data due to context length restriction. Besides, existing works have shown that ICL also suffers from various biases and requires delicate calibration treatment. To address both challenges, we advocate a simple and effective solution, $k$NN Prompting, which first queries LLM with training data for distributed representations, then predicts test instances by simply referring to nearest neighbors. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate its two-fold superiority: 1) Calibration-Free: $k$NN Prompting does not directly align LLM output distribution with task-specific label space, instead leverages such distribution to align test and training instances. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art calibration-based methods under comparable few-shot scenario. 2) Beyond-Context: $k$NN Prompting can further scale up effectively with as many training data as are available, continually bringing substantial improvements. The scaling trend holds across 10 orders of magnitude ranging from 2 shots to 1024 shots as well as different LLMs scales ranging from 0.8B to 30B. It successfully bridges data scaling into model scaling, and brings new potentials for the gradient-free paradigm of LLM deployment.

ICLR,2023,Internet-augmented language models through few-shot prompting for open-domain question answering,"In this work, we aim to capitalize on the unique few-shot capabilities of large-scale language models (LSLMs) to overcome some of their challenges with respect to grounding to factual and up-to-date information. Motivated by semi-parametric lan4 guage models (LMs), which ground their decisions in external retrieved evidence, we use few-shot prompting to learn to condition LMs on information returned from the web using Google Search, a broad and constantly updated knowledge source. Our approach does not involve fine-tuning or learning additional parameters, thus making it applicable to any LM, offering therefore a strong baseline. Indeed, we find that LMs conditioned on the web surpass performance of closed-book models of similar, or even larger, model sizes in open-domain question answering. Finally, we find that increasing the inference-time compute of models, achieved via using multiple retrieved evidences to generate multiple answers followed by a reranking stage that uses scores generated by the same LMs, leads to better performance and alleviates lower performance of smaller few-shot LMs. All in all, our findings suggest that it might be beneficial to slow down the race towards the biggest model and instead shift attention towards finding more effective ways to use models, including but not limited to, better prompting or increasing inference-time compute.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,VIP: Towards Universal Visual Reward and Representation via Value-Implicit Pre-Training,"Reward and representation learning are two long-standing challenges for learning an expanding set of robot manipulation skills from sensory observations. Given the inherent cost and scarcity of in-domain, task-specific robot data, learning from large, diverse, offline human videos has emerged as a promising path towards acquiring a generally useful visual representation for control; however, how these human videos can be used for general-purpose reward learning remains an open question. We introduce $\textbf{V}$alue-$\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{P}$re-training (VIP), a self-supervised pre-trained visual representation capable of generating dense and smooth reward functions for unseen robotic tasks. VIP casts representation learning from human videos as an offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and derives a self-supervised dual goal-conditioned value-function objective that does not depend on actions, enabling pre-training on unlabeled human videos. Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel implicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth embedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the embedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any goal-image specified downstream task. Trained on large-scale Ego4D human videos and without any fine-tuning on in-domain, task-specific data, VIP can provide dense visual reward for an extensive set of simulated and $\textbf{real-robot}$ tasks, enabling diverse reward-based visual control methods and significantly outperforming all prior pre-trained representations. Notably, VIP can enable simple, few-shot offline RL on a suite of real-world robot tasks with as few as 20 trajectories.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Bidirectional Language Models Are Also Few-shot Learners,"Large language models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) can perform arbitrary tasks without undergoing fine-tuning after being prompted with only a few labeled examples. An arbitrary task can be reformulated as a natural language prompt, and a language model can be asked to generate the completion, indirectly performing the task in a paradigm known as prompt-based learning. To date, emergent prompt-based learning capabilities have mainly been demonstrated for unidirectional language models. However, bidirectional language models pre-trained on denoising objectives such as masked language modeling produce stronger learned representations for transfer learning. This motivates the possibility of prompting bidirectional models, but their pre-training objectives have made them largely incompatible with the existing prompting paradigm. We present SAP (Sequential Autoregressive Prompting), a technique that enables the prompting of bidirectional models. Utilizing the machine translation task as a case study, we prompt the bidirectional mT5 model (Xue et al., 2021) with SAP and demonstrate its few-shot and zero-shot translations outperform the few-shot translations of unidirectional models like GPT-3 and XGLM (Lin et al., 2021), despite mT5's approximately 50% fewer parameters. We further show SAP is effective on question answering and summarization. For the first time, our results demonstrate prompt-based learning is an emergent property of a broader class of language models, rather than only unidirectional models.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,In-context Reinforcement Learning with Algorithm Distillation,"We propose Algorithm Distillation (AD), a method for distilling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms into neural networks by modeling their training histories with a causal sequence model. Algorithm Distillation treats learning to reinforcement learn as an across-episode sequential prediction problem. A dataset of learning histories is generated by a source RL algorithm, and then a causal transformer is trained by autoregressively predicting actions given their preceding learning histories as context. Unlike sequential policy prediction architectures that distill post-learning or expert sequences, AD is able to improve its policy entirely in-context without updating its network parameters. We demonstrate that AD can reinforcement learn in-context in a variety of environments with sparse rewards, combinatorial task structure, and pixel-based observations, and find that AD learns a more data-efficient RL algorithm than the one that generated the source data.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Logical Reasoning,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of impressive few-shot generalisation to new tasks. However, they still tend to perform poorly on multi-step logical reasoning problems. Here we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on 46 tasks that probe different aspects of logical reasoning. We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks. Moreover, answers produced by the SI framework are accompanied by a causal natural-language-based reasoning trace, which has important implications for the safety and trustworthiness of the system.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2023,Contrastive Meta-Learning for Partially Observable Few-Shot Learning,"Many contrastive and meta-learning approaches learn representations by identifying common features in multiple views. However, the formalism for these approaches generally assumes features to be shared across views to be captured coherently. We consider the problem of learning a unified representation from partial observations, where useful features may be present in only some of the views. We approach this through a probabilistic formalism enabling views to map to representations with different levels of uncertainty in different components; these views can then be integrated with one another through marginalisation over that uncertainty. Our approach, Partial Observation Experts Modelling (POEM), then enables us to meta-learn consistent representations from partial observations. We evaluate our approach on an adaptation of a comprehensive few-shot learning benchmark, Meta-Dataset, and demonstrate the benefits of POEM over other meta-learning methods at representation learning from partial observations. We further demonstrate the utility of POEM by meta-learning to represent an environment from partial views observed by an agent exploring the environment.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2023,Zero-Label Prompt Selection,"Natural language prompts have been shown to facilitate cross-task generalization for large language models. However, with no or limited labeled examples, the cross-task performance is highly sensitive to the choice of prompts, while selecting a high-performing prompt is challenging given the scarcity of labels. To address the issue, we propose a Zero-Label Prompt Selection (ZPS) method that selects prompts without any labeled data or gradient update. Specifically, given the candidate human-written prompts for a task, ZPS labels a set of unlabeled data with a prompt ensemble and uses the pseudo-labels for prompt selection. Experiments show that ZPS improves over prior methods by a sizeable margin in zero-label performance. We also extend ZPS to a few-shot setting and show its advantages over strong baselines such as prompt tuning and model tuning.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2023,Fine-grained Few-shot Recognition by Deep Object Parsing,"We propose a new method for fine-grained few-shot recognition via deep object parsing. In our framework, an object is made up of $K$ distinct parts and for each part, we learn a dictionary of templates, which is shared across all instances and categories. An object is parsed by estimating the locations of these $K$ parts and a set of active templates that can reconstruct the part features.  We recognize test instances by comparing its active templates and the relative geometry of its part locations against those of the presented few-shot instances. Our method is end-to-end trainable to learn part templates on-top of a convolutional backbone. To combat visual distortions such as orientation, pose and size, we learn templates at multiple scales, and at test-time parse and match instances across these scales. We show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art, and by virtue of parsing enjoys interpretability as well.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Inversely Eliciting Numerical Reasoning in Language Models via Solving Linear Systems,"Numerical reasoning over natural language has been a long-standing goal for the research community. However, recent language models have proven difficult to reliably generalize to a broad range of numbers, although they have shown proficiency in reasoning over common and simple numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel method to elicit and exploit the numerical reasoning knowledge hidden in pre-trained language models using simple anchor numbers. Concretely, we first leverage simple numbers as anchors to probe the implicitly inferred arithmetic expressions from language models, and then explicitly apply the expressions on complex numbers to get corresponding answers. To inversely elicit arithmetic expressions, we transform and formulate the task as an analytically solvable linear system. Experimental results on several numerical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is highly effective. More importantly, our approach works in the inference phase without extra model training, making it highly portable and achieving significant and consistent performance benefits across a variety of language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Semantic Prior for Weakly Supervised Class-Incremental Segmentation,"Class-incremental semantic image segmentation assumes multiple model updates, each enriching the model to segment new categories. This is typically carried out by providing pixel-level manual annotations for all new objects, limiting the adoption of such methods. Approaches which solely require image-level labels offer an attractive alternative, yet, such annotations lack crucial information about the location and boundary of new objects. In this paper we argue that, since classes represent not just indices but semantic entities, the conceptual relationships between them can provide valuable information that should be leveraged. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages such semantic relations in order to transfer some cues from the previously learned classes into the new ones, complementing the supervisory signal from image-level labels. We validate our approach on a number of continual learning tasks, and show how even a simple pairwise interaction between classes can significantly improve the segmentation mask quality of both old and new classes. We show these conclusions still hold for longer and, hence, more realistic sequences of tasks and for a challenging few-shot scenario.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2023,Diversity of Generated Unlabeled Data Matters for Few-shot Hypothesis Adaptation,"Generating unlabeled data has been recently shown to help address the few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA) problem, where we aim to train a classifier for the target domain with a few labeled target-domain data and a well-trained source-domain classifier (i.e., a source hypothesis), for the additional information of the highly-compatible unlabeled data. However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective for addressing the FHA problem. Experimental results show that the DEG-Net outperforms existing FHA baselines and further verifies that generating diverse data plays an important role in addressing the FHA problem.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Revisit Finetuning strategy for Few-Shot Learning to Transfer the Emdeddings,"Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to learn a simple and effective bias on limited novel samples. Recently, many methods have been focused on re-training a randomly initialized linear classifier to adapt it to the novel features extracted by the pre-trained feature extractor (called Linear-Probing-based methods). These methods typically assumed the pre-trained feature extractor was robust enough, i.e., finetuning was not needed, and hence the pre-trained feature extractor does not change on the novel samples. However, the unchanged pre-trained feature extractor will distort the features of novel samples because the robustness assumption may not hold, especially on the out-of-distribution samples. To extract the undistorted features, we designed Linear-Probing-Finetuning with Firth-Bias (LP-FT-FB) to yield an accurate bias on the limited samples for better finetuning the pre-trained feature extractor, providing stronger transferring ability. In LP-FT-FB, we further proposed inverse Firth Bias Reduction (i-FBR) to regularize the over-parameterized feature extractor on which FBR does not work well.	The proposed i-FBR effectively alleviates the over-fitting problem of the feature extractor in the process of finetuning and helps extract undistorted novel features. To show the effectiveness of the designed LP-FT-FB, we conducted a lot of experiments on the commonly used FSL datasets under different backbones, including in-domain and cross-domain FSL tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed FT-LP-FB outperforms the SOTA FSL methods. The code is available at https://github.com/whzyf951620/LinearProbingFinetuningFirthBias.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Scalable Multi-Modal Continual Meta-Learning,"This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are sequentially available and sampled from a non-stationary distribution. Motivated by this challenging setting, many works have been developed with a mixture of meta-knowledge to cope with the heterogeneity and a dynamically changing number of components to capture incremental information. However, the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components prevents sharing meta-knowledge across different clusters of tasks. Moreover, the existing incremental methods only rely on the prior to determine whether to increase meta-knowledge, where the unlimited increase would lead to parameter inefficiency. In our work, we propose a Scalable Multi-Modal Continual Meta-Learning (SMM-CML) algorithm. It employs a multi-modal premise that not only encourages different clusters of tasks to share meta-knowledge but also maintains their diversity. Moreover, to capture the incremental information, our algorithm uses Indian Buffet Process (IBP) as a prior number of components and proposes a sparsity method based on evidential theory to filter out the components without receiving support information directly from tasks. Thus we can learn the posterior number of components to avoid parameter inefficiency and reduce computational consumption. Experiments show SMM-CML outperforms SOTA baselines, which illustrates the effectiveness of our multi-modal meta-knowledge, and confirms that our algorithm can learn the really need meta-knowledge from tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Knowledge-in-Context: Towards Knowledgeable Semi-Parametric Language Models,"Fully-parametric language models generally require a huge number of model parameters to store the necessary knowledge for solving multiple natural language tasks in zero/few-shot settings. In addition, it is hard to adapt to the evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture, Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory contains six different types of knowledge:  entity,  dictionary, commonsense, event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting. Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE. This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+ different tasks, we show that KiC-Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms large language models that are 4-39x larger. In addition, KiC also exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale compared to the fully-parametric models.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2023,Mind's Eye: Grounded Language Model Reasoning through Simulation,"Successful and effective communication between humans and AI relies on a shared experience of the world. By training solely on written text, current language models (LMs) miss the grounded experience of humans in the real-world---their failure to relate language to the physical world causes knowledge to be misrepresented and obvious mistakes in their reasoning. We present Mind's Eye, a paradigm to ground language model reasoning in the physical world. Given a physical reasoning question, we use a computational physics engine (DeepMind's MuJoCo) to simulate the possible outcomes, and then use the simulation results as part of the input, which enables language models to perform reasoning. Experiments on 39 tasks in a physics alignment benchmark demonstrate that Mind's Eye can improve reasoning ability by a large margin (27.9% zero-shot, and 46.0% few-shot absolute accuracy improvement on average). Smaller language models armed with Mind's Eye can obtain similar performance to models that are 100x larger. Finally, we confirm the robustness of Mind's Eye through ablation studies.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Sampled Transformer for Point Sets,"The sparse transformer can reduce the computational complexity of the self-attention layers to $O(n)$, whilst still being a universal approximator of continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. However, this permutation variant operation is not appropriate for direct application to sets. In this paper, we proposed an $O(n)$ complexity sampled transformer that can process point set elements directly without any additional inductive bias. Our sampled transformer introduces random element sampling, which randomly splits point sets into subsets, followed by applying a shared Hamiltonian self-attention mechanism to each subset. The overall attention mechanism can be viewed as a Hamiltonian cycle in the complete attention graph, and the permutation of point set elements is equivalent to randomly sampling Hamiltonian cycles. This mechanism implements a Monte Carlo simulation of the $O(n^2)$ dense attention connections. We show that it is a universal approximator for continuous set-to-set functions.  Experimental results for classification and few-shot learning on point-clouds show comparable or better accuracy with significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the dense transformer or alternative sparse attention schemes.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2023,Meta-Weighted Language Model Tuning for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning,"Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Task Ambiguity in Humans and Language Models,"Language models have recently achieved strong performance across a wide range of NLP benchmarks. However, real world tasks are often poorly specified, and agents must deduce the intended behavior from a combination of context, instructions, and examples. We investigate how both humans and models behave in the face of such task ambiguity by proposing AmbiBench, a new benchmark of six ambiguously-specified classification tasks. We evaluate humans and models on AmbiBench by seeing how well they identify the intended task using 1) instructions with varying degrees of ambiguity, and 2) different numbers of labeled examples. We find that the combination of model scaling (to 175B parameters) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) enables models to approach or exceed the accuracy of human participants across tasks, but that either one of these alone is not sufficient. In addition, we show how to dramatically improve the accuracy of language models trained without RLHF by finetuning on a small number of ambiguous in-context examples, providing a promising direction for teaching models to generalize well in the face of ambiguity.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,GAPS: Few-Shot Incremental Semantic Segmentation via Guided Copy-Paste Synthesis,"Few-shot incremental segmentation is the task of updating a segmentation model, as novel classes are introduced online overtime with a small number of training images. Although incremental segmentation methods exist in the literature, they tend to fall short in the few-shot regime and when given partially-annotated training images, where only the novel class is segmented. This paper proposes a data synthesizer, Guided copy-And-Paste Synthesis (GAPS), that improves the performance of few-shot incremental segmentation in a model-agnostic fashion. Despite the great success of copy-paste synthesis in the conventional offline visual recognition, we demonstrate substantially degraded performance of its naive extension in our online scenario, due to newly encountered challenges. To this end, GAPS (i) addresses the partial-annotation problem by leveraging copy-paste to generate fully-labeled data for training, (ii) helps augment the few images of novel objects by introducing a guided sampling process, and (iii) mitigates catastrophic forgetting by employing a diverse memory-replay buffer. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, GAPS dramatically boosts the novel IoU of baseline methods on established few-shot incremental segmentation benchmarks by up to 80%. More notably, GAPS maintains good performance in even more impoverished annotation settings, where only single instances of novel objects are annotated.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2023,Pre-trained Language Models can be Fully Zero-Shot Learners,"How can we extend a pre-trained model to many language understanding tasks, without labeled or additional unlabeled data? Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been effective for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, existing approaches either require fine-tuning on downstream labeled datasets or manually constructing proper prompts. In this paper, we propose nonparametric prompting PLM (NPPrompt) for fully zero-shot language understanding. Unlike previous methods, NPPrompt uses only pre-trained language models and does not require any labeled data or additional raw corpus for further fine-tuning, nor does it rely on humans to construct a comprehensive set of prompt label words. We evaluate NPPrompt against previous major few-shot and zero-shot learning methods on diverse NLP tasks: including text classification, text entailment, similar text retrieval, and paraphrasing.

SoftNet jointly learns the model weights and adaptive non-binary soft masks at a base training session in which each mask consists of the major and minor subnetwork; the former aims to minimize catastrophic forgetting during training, and the latter aims to avoid overfitting to a few samples in each new training session.

ICLR,2023,Node Importance Specific Meta Learning in Graph Neural Networks,"While current node classification methods for graphs have enabled significant progress in many applications, they rely on abundant labeled nodes for training. In many real-world datasets, nodes for some classes are always scarce, thus current algorithms are ill-equipped to handle these few-shot node classes. Some meta learning approaches for graphs have demonstrated advantages in tackling such few-shot problems, but they disregard the impact of node importance on a task. Being exclusive to graph data, the dependencies between nodes convey vital information for determining the importance of nodes in contrast to node features only, which poses unique challenges here. In this paper, we investigate the effect of node importance in node classification meta learning tasks. We first theoretically analyze the influence of distinguishing node importance on the lower bound of the model accuracy. Then, based on the theoretical conclusion, we propose a novel Node Importance Meta Learning architecture (NIML) that learns and applies the importance score of each node for meta learning. Specifically, after constructing an attention vector based on the interaction between a node and its neighbors, we train an importance predictor in a supervised manner to capture the distance between node embedding and the expectation of same-class embedding.

ICLR,2023,Overthinking the Truth: Understanding how Language Models process False Demonstrations,"Through few-shot learning or chain-of-thought prompting, modern language models 
can detect and imitate complex patterns in their prompt. 
This behavior allows language models to complete challenging tasks without fine-tuning, 
but can be at odds with completion quality: if the context is inaccurate or harmful, then the model 
may reproduce these defects in its completions.
In this work, we show that this {harmful context-following} appears late in a model's 
computation--in particular, given an inaccurate context, models perform \emph{better} after zeroing out later layers. 
More concretely, at early layers models have similar performance given either accurate and inaccurate few-shot prompts, but a gap appears at later layers (e.g.~layers 10-14 for GPT-J).
This gap appears at a consistent depth across datasets, and coincides with the appearance of “induction heads” that attend to previous answers in the prompt. 
We restore the performance for inaccurate contexts by ablating a subset of these heads, reducing the gap by 28\% on average across 8 datasets.
Our results suggest that studying early stages of computation could be a promising strategy to prevent misleading outputs, and that understanding and editing internal

In this paper, we explore how ensemble methods can improve recent SSL techniques by developing a framework that permits data-dependent weighted cross-entropy losses.  We refrain from ensembling the representation backbone; this choice yields an efficient ensemble method that incurs a small training cost and requires no architectural changes or computational overhead to downstream evaluation. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with two state-of-the-art SSL methods, DINO (Caron et al., 2021) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022). Our method outperforms both in multiple evaluation metrics on ImageNet-1K, particularly in the few-shot setting. We explore several weighting schemes and find that those which increase the diversity of ensemble heads lead to better downstream evaluation results.

Different from existing prototypical few-shot methods that use the averages of support instances to calculate the class prototypes, we propose to learn class prototypes from the concatenated features of the support set in a parametric fashion and meta-learn the model by enforcing prototype-based regularization on the query set. 
In addition, we fine-tune the model in the target domain in a transductive manner using a weighted-moving-average self-training approach on the query instances.

In this work, we propose an outlier robust self-training method based on graduated non-convexity (GNC) to mitigate the problem. We construct self-training as a non-convex optimization problem with outlier training examples. The models are self-trained with robust cost functions based according to Black-Rangarajan Duality. The algorithm learns slack variables as the loss weights for all training samples. The slack variables are used to calibrate the loss items during training to update the model parameters. The calibrated loss items lead to more robust self-trained models against different training and evaluation data and tasks. We conducted experiments on few-shot natural language understanding tasks with labeled and unlabeled data examples. Experiment results show that the proposed loss calibration method improves the performance and stability of self-training under different training tasks and data examples, and also benefits the robustness against adversarial evaluation corpora.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,MERMADE: $K$-shot Robust Adaptive Mechanism Design via Model-Based Meta-Learning,"Mechanism design (MD) studies how rules and rewards shape the behavior of intelligent agents, e.g., in auctions or the economy. Simulations with AI agents are powerful tools for MD, but real-world agents may behave and learn differently than simulated agents under a given mechanism. Also, the mechanism designer may not fully observe an agent's learning strategy or rewards, and executing a mechanism may be costly, e.g., enforcing a tax might require extra labor. Hence, it is key to design robust adaptive mechanisms that generalize well to agents  with unseen (learning) behavior, are few-shot adaptable, and are cost-efficient. Here, we introduce MERMADE, a model-based meta-learning framework to learn mechanisms that can quickly adapt when facing out-of-distribution agents with different learning strategies and reward functions. First, we show that meta-learning allows adapting to the theoretically known and appropriate Stackelberg equilibrium in a simple matrix game at meta-test time, with few interactions with the agent. Second, with bandit agents, we show empirically that our approach yields strong meta-test time performance against agents with various unseen explore-exploit behaviors. Finally, we outperform baselines that separately use either meta-learning or agent behavior modeling to learn a cost-effective mechanism that is $K$-shot adaptable with only partial information about the agents.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2023,Layer Grafted Pre-training: Bridging Contrastive Learning And Masked Image Modeling For Label-Efficient Representations,"Recently, both Contrastive Learning (CL) and Mask Image Modeling (MIM) demonstrate that self-supervision is powerful to learn good representations. However, naively combining them is far from success. In this paper, we start by making the empirical observation that a naive joint optimization of CL and MIM losses leads to conflicting gradient directions - more severe as the layers go deeper. This motivates us to shift the paradigm from combining loss at the end, to choosing the proper learning method per network layer. Inspired by experimental observations, we find that MIM and CL are suitable to lower and higher layers, respectively. We hence propose to combine them in a surprisingly simple, ``sequential cascade'' fashion: early layers are first trained under one MIM loss, on top of which latter layers continue to be trained under another CL loss. The proposed Layer Grafted Pre-training learns good visual representations that demonstrate superior label efficiency in downstream applications, in particular yielding strong few-shot performance besides linear evaluation. For instance, on ImageNet-1k, Layer Grafted Pre-training yields 65.5% Top-1 accuracy in terms of 1% few-shot learning with ViT-B/16, which improves MIM and CL baselines by 14.4% and 2.1% with no bells and whistles.

ICLR,2023,The Curse of Low Task Diversity: On the Failure of Transfer Learning to Outperform MAML and their Empirical Equivalence,"Recently, it has been observed that a transfer learning solution might be all we need to solve many few-shot learning benchmarks -- thus raising important questions about when and how meta-learning algorithms should be deployed. 
In this paper, we seek to clarify these questions by 
1. proposing a novel metric -- the {\it diversity coefficient} -- to measure the diversity of tasks in a few-shot learning benchmark and 
2. by comparing MAML and transfer learning under fair conditions (same architecture, same optimizer and all models trained to convergence).
Using the diversity coefficient, we show that the popular MiniImagenet and Cifar-fs few-shot learning benchmarks have low diversity. 
This novel insight contextualizes claims that transfer learning solutions are better than meta-learned solutions in the regime of low diversity under a fair comparison. 
Specifically, we empirically find that a low diversity coefficient correlates with a high similarity between transfer learning and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) learned solutions in terms of accuracy at meta-test time and classification layer similarity (using feature based distance metrics like SVCCA, PWCCA, CKA, and OPD). 
To further support our claim, we find this meta-test accuracy holds even as the model size changes. 
Therefore, we conclude that in the low diversity regime, MAML and transfer learning have equivalent meta-test performance when both are compared fairly.
We also hope our work inspires more thoughtful constructions and quantitative evaluations of meta-learning benchmarks in the future.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Hebbian and Gradient-based Plasticity Enables Robust Memory and Rapid Learning in RNNs,"Rapidly learning from ongoing experiences and remembering past events with a flexible memory system are two core capacities of biological intelligence. While the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, various evidence supports that synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in memory formation and fast learning. Inspired by these results, we equip Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with plasticity rules to enable them to adapt their parameters according to ongoing experiences. In addition to the traditional local Hebbian plasticity, we propose a global, gradient-based plasticity rule, which allows the model to evolve towards its self-determined target. Our models show promising results on sequential and associative memory tasks, illustrating their ability to robustly form and retain memories. In the meantime, these models can cope with many challenging few-shot learning problems. Comparing different plasticity rules under the same framework shows that Hebbian plasticity is well-suited for several memory and associative learning tasks; however, it is outperformed by gradient-based plasticity on few-shot regression tasks which require the model to infer the underlying mapping.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Few-shot Cross-domain Image Generation via Inference-time Latent-code Learning,"In this work, our objective is to adapt a Deep generative model trained on a large-scale source dataset to multiple target domains with scarce data. Specifically, we focus on adapting a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to a target domain without re-training the generator. Our method draws the motivation from the fact that out-of-distribution samples can be `embedded' onto the latent space of a pre-trained source-GAN. We propose to train a small latent-generation network during the inference stage, each time a  batch of target samples is to be generated. These target latent codes are fed to the source-generator to obtain  novel target samples. Despite using the same small set of target samples and the source generator, multiple independent training episodes of the latent-generation network results in the diversity of the generated target samples. Our method, albeit simple, can be used to generate data from multiple target distributions using a generator trained on a single source distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our surprisingly simple method in generating multiple target datasets with only a single source generator and a few target samples.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2023,Hard-Meta-Dataset++: Towards Understanding Few-Shot Performance on Difficult Tasks,"Few-shot classification is the ability to adapt to any new classification task from only a few training examples. The performance of current top-performing few-shot classifiers varies widely across different tasks where they often fail on a subset of `difficult' tasks.
This phenomenon has real-world consequences for deployed few-shot systems where safety and reliability are paramount, yet little has been done to understand these failure cases. In this paper, we study these difficult tasks to gain a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of current methods. To this end, we develop a general and computationally efficient algorithm called FastDiffSel to extract difficult tasks from any large-scale vision dataset. Notably, our algorithm can extract tasks at least 20x faster than existing methods enabling its use on large-scale datasets. We use FastDiffSel to extract difficult tasks from Meta-Datasset, a widely-used few-shot classification benchmark, and other challenging large-scale vision datasets including ORBIT, CURE-OR and ObjectNet. These tasks are curated into Hard-MD++, a new few-shot testing benchmark to promote the development of methods that are robust to even the most difficult tasks. We use Hard-MD++ to stress-test an extensive suite of few-shot classification methods and show that state-of-the-art approaches fail catastrophically on difficult tasks. We believe that our extraction algorithm FastDiffSel and Hard-MD++ will aid researchers in further understanding failure modes of few-shot classification models.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Prompting GPT-3 To Be Reliable,"Large language models (LLMs) show impressive abilities via few-shot prompting. Commercialized APIs such as OpenAI GPT-3 further increase their use in real-world language applications. However, the crucial problem of how to improve the reliability of GPT-3 is still under-explored. While reliability is a broad and vaguely defined term, we decompose reliability into four main facets that correspond to the existing framework of ML safety and are well-recognized to be important: generalizability, social biases, calibration, and factuality. Our core contribution is to establish simple and effective prompts that improve GPT-3’s reliability as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution, 2) balances demographic distribution and uses natural language instructions to reduce social biases, 3) calibrates output probabilities, and 4) updates the LLM’s factual knowledge and reasoning chains. With appropriate prompts, GPT-3 is more reliable than smaller-scale supervised models on all these facets. We release all processed datasets, evaluation scripts, and model predictions. Our systematic empirical study not only sheds new insights on the reliability of prompting LLMs, but more importantly, our prompting strategies can help practitioners more reliably use LLMs like GPT-3.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Loss Landscapes are All You Need: Neural Network Generalization Can Be Explained Without the Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent,"It is commonly believed that the implicit regularization of optimizers is needed for neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we observe experimentally that this implicit regularization behavior is {\em generic}, i.e. it does not depend strongly on the choice of optimizer. We demonstrate this by training neural networks using several gradient-free optimizers, which do not benefit from properties that are often attributed to gradient-based optimizers.   This includes a guess-and-check optimizer that generates uniformly random parameter vectors until finding one that happens to achieve perfect train accuracy, and a zeroth-order Pattern Search optimizer that uses no gradient computations. In the low sample and few-shot regimes, where zeroth order optimizers are most computationally tractable, we find that these non-gradient optimizers achieve test accuracy comparable to SGD.

ICLR,2023,Less is More: Rethinking Few-Shot Learning and Recurrent Neural Nets,"The statistical supervised learning framework assumes an input-output set with a joint probability distribution that is reliably represented by the training dataset. The learner is then required to output a prediction rule learned from the training dataset's input-output pairs. In this work, we provide meaningful insights into the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) \citep{Shannon:1948} in the context of machine learning, and illuminate some of its potential ramifications for few-shot learning. We provide theoretical guarantees for reliable learning under the information-theoretic AEP, and for the generalization error with respect to the sample size. We then focus on a highly efficient recurrent neural net (RNN) framework and propose a reduced-entropy algorithm for few-shot learning. We also propose a mathematical intuition for the RNN as an approximation of a sparse coding solver. We verify the applicability, robustness, and computational efficiency of the proposed approach with image deblurring and optical coherence tomography (OCT) speckle suppression. Our experimental results demonstrate significant potential for improving learning models' sample efficiency, generalization, and time complexity, that can therefore be leveraged for practical real-time applications.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Warping the Space: Weight Space Rotation for Class-Incremental Few-Shot Learning,"Class-incremental few-shot learning, where new sets of classes are provided sequentially with only a few training samples, presents a great challenge due to catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge and overfitting caused by lack of data. During finetuning on new classes, the performance on previous classes deteriorates quickly even when only a small fraction of parameters are updated, since the previous knowledge is broadly associated with most of the model parameters in the original parameter space. In this paper, we introduce WaRP, the \textit{weight space rotation process}, which transforms the original parameter space into a new space so that we can push most of the previous knowledge compactly into only a few important parameters. By properly identifying and freezing these key parameters in the new weight space, we can finetune the remaining parameters without affecting the knowledge of previous classes. As a result, WaRP provides an additional room for the model to effectively learn new classes in future incremental sessions. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our solution and show the improved performance over the state-of-the-art methods.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2023,Worst-case Few-shot Evaluation: Are Neural Networks Robust Few-shot Learners?,"Neural networks have achieved remarkable performance on various few-shot tasks. However, recent studies reveal that existing few-shot models often exploit the spurious correlations between training and test sets, achieving a high performance that is hard to generalize. Motivated that a robust few-shot learner should accurately classify data given any valid training set, we consider a worst-case few-shot evaluation that computes worst-case generalization errors by constructing a challenging few-shot set. Specifically, we search for the label-balanced subset of a full-size training set that results in the largest expected risks. Since the search space is enormous, we propose an efficient method NMMD-attack to optimize the target by maximizing NMMD distance (maximum mean discrepancy based on neural tangent kernel). Experiments show that NMMD-attack can successfully attack various architectures. The large gap between average performance and worst-case performance shows that neural networks still suffer from poor robustness. We appeal to more worst-case benchmarks for better robust few-shot evaluation.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Improving Out-of-distribution Generalization with Indirection Representations,"We propose a generic module named Indirection Layer (InLay), which leverages indirection and data internal relationships to effectively construct symbolic indirect representations to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of various neural architectures. InLay receives data input in the form of a sequence of objects, treats it as a complete weighted graph whose vertices are the objects and edge weights are scalars representing relationships between vertices. The input is first mapped via indirection to a symbolic graph with data-independent and trainable vertices. This symbolic graph is then propagated, resulting in new vertex features whose indirection will be used for prediction steps afterward. Theoretically, we show that the distances between indirection representations are bounded by the distances between corresponding graphs, implying that unseen samples with very different surface statistics can still be close in the representation space to the seen samples if they share similar internal relationships. We demonstrate that InLay is consistently effective in improving out-of-distribution generalization throughout a comprehensive suite of experiments, including IQ problems, distorted image classification, and few-shot domain adaptation NLP classification. We also conduct ablation studies to verify different design choices of InLay.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2023,Context-enriched molecule representations improve few-shot drug discovery,"A central task in computational drug discovery is to construct models from known active molecules to find further promising molecules for subsequent screening. However, typically only very few active molecules are known. Therefore, few-shot learning methods have the potential to improve the effectiveness of this critical phase of the drug discovery process. We introduce a new method for few-shot drug discovery. Its main idea is to enrich a molecule representation by knowledge about known context or reference molecules. Our novel concept for molecule representation enrichment is to associate molecules from both the support set and the query set with a large set of reference (context) molecules through a modern Hopfield network. Intuitively, this enrichment step is analogous to a human expert who would associate a given molecule with familiar molecules whose properties are known. The enrichment step reinforces and amplifies the covariance structure of the data, while simultaneously removing spurious correlations arising from the decoration of molecules. Our approach is compared with other few-shot methods for drug discovery on the FS-Mol benchmark dataset. On FS-Mol, our approach outperforms all compared methods and therefore sets a new state-of-the art for few-shot learning in drug discovery. An ablation study shows that the enrichment step of our method is the key to improve the predictive quality. In a domain shift experiment, we further demonstrate the robustness of our method.",📊 评测基准与数据集

We develop the first application of Personalized Federated Hypernetworks (PFH) to Reinforcement Learning (RL). We then present a novel application of PFH to few-shot transfer, and demonstrate significant initial increases in learning. PFH has never been demonstrated beyond supervised learning benchmarks, so we apply PFH to an important domain: RL price-setting for energy demand response. We consider a general case across where agents are split across multiple microgrids, wherein energy consumption data must be kept private within each microgrid. Together, our work explores how the fields of personalized federated learning and RL can come together to make learning efficient across multiple tasks while keeping data secure.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2023,Few-Shot Anomaly Detection on Industrial Images through Contrastive Fine-Tuning,"Detecting abnormal products through imagery data is essential to the quality control in manufacturing. Existing approaches towards anomaly detection~(AD) often rely on substantial amount of anomaly-free samples to train representation and density models. Nevertheless, large anomaly-free datasets may not always be available before inference stage and this requires building an anomaly detection framework with only a handful of normal samples, a.k.a. few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD). We propose two techniques to address the challenges in FSAD. First, we employ a  model pretrained on large source dataset to initialize model weights. To ameliorate the covariate shift between source and target domains, we adopt contrastive training on the few-shot target domain data. Second, to encourage learning representations suitable for downstream AD, we further incorporate cross-instance pairs to increase tightness within normal sample cluster and better separation between normal and synthesized negative samples. Extensive evaluations on six few-shot anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",📊 评测基准与数据集

In this work, we propose prototypical calibration to adaptively learn a more robust decision boundary for zero- and few-shot classification, instead of greedy decoding. Concretely, our method first adopts Gaussian mixture distribution to estimate the prototypical clusters for all categories. Then we assign each cluster to the corresponding label by solving a weighted bipartite matching problem. Given an example, its prediction is calibrated by the likelihood of prototypical clusters. Experimental results show that prototypical calibration yields a substantial improvement on a diverse set of tasks. Extensive analysis across different scales also indicates that our method calibrates the decision boundary as expected, greatly improving the robustness of GPT to templates, permutations, and class imbalance.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2023,Few-Shot Learning with Representative Global Prototype,"Few-shot learning is often challenged by low generalization performance due to the assumption that the data distribution of novel classes and base classes is similar while the model is trained only on the base classes. To mitigate the above issues, we propose a few-shot learning with representative global prototype method. Specifically, to enhance the generalization to novel classes, we propose a method to jointly train the base classes and the novel classes, using selected representative and non-representative samples to optimize representative global prototypes, respectively. Additionally, a method that organically combines the sample of base classes conditional on semantic embedding to generate new samples of novel classes with the original data is proposed to enhance the data of novel classes. Results show that this training method improves the model's ability to describe novel classes, improving the classification performance for a few shots. Intensive experiments have been conducted on two popular benchmark datasets, and the experimental results show that this method significantly improves the classification ability of few-shot learning tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",📊 评测基准与数据集

While the above methods do not meet the requirement of few-shot learning, which requires abundant labeled samples. Therefore, We propose a new model framework to get representative prototypes with semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduces the dataset containing unlabeled samples to assist training the model. More importantly, to fully utilize these unlabeled samples, we adopt conditional variational autoencoder to construct more representative prototypes. Simultaneously, we develop novel contrastive loss to improve the model generalization ability. We evaluate our method on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks for both 1-shot and 5-shot settings and achieve better performance over the state-of-the-art semisupervised few-shot method.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models,"State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,In-Context Policy Iteration,"This work presents In-Context Policy Iteration, an algorithm for performing Reinforcement Learning (RL), in-context, using foundation models. While the application of foundation models to RL has received considerable attention, most approaches rely on either (1) the curation of expert demonstrations (either through manual design or task-specific pretraining) or (2) adaptation to the task of interest using gradient methods (either fine-tuning or training of adapter layers). Both of these techniques have drawbacks. Collecting demonstrations is labor-intensive, and algorithms that rely on them do not outperform the experts from which the demonstrations were derived. All gradient techniques are inherently slow, sacrificing the “few-shot” quality that made in-context learning attractive to begin with. In this work, we present an algorithm, ICPI, that learns to perform RL tasks without expert demonstrations or gradients. Instead we present a policy-iteration method in which the prompt content is the entire locus of learning. ICPI iteratively updates the contents of the prompt from which it derives its policy through trial-and-error interaction with an RL environment. In order to eliminate the role of in-weights learning (on which approaches like Decision Transformer rely heavily), we demonstrate our algorithm using Codex Chen et al.

ICLR,2023,Knowledge-Driven New Drug Recommendation,"Drug recommendation assists doctors in prescribing personalized medications to patients based on their health conditions. Existing drug recommendation solutions adopt the supervised multi-label classification setup and only work with existing drugs with sufficient prescription data from many patients. However, newly approved drugs do not have much historical prescription data and cannot leverage existing drug recommendation methods. To address this, we formulate the new drug recommendation as a few-shot learning problem. Yet, directly applying existing few-shot learning algorithms faces two challenges: (1) complex relations among diseases and drugs and (2) numerous false-negative patients who were eligible but did not yet use the new drugs. To tackle these challenges, we propose EDGE, which can quickly adapt to the recommendation for a new drug with limited prescription data from a few support patients. EDGE maintains a drug-dependent multi-phenotype few-shot learner to bridge the gap between existing and new drugs. Specifically, EDGE leverages the drug ontology to link new drugs to existing drugs with similar treatment effects and learns ontology-based drug representations. Such drug representations are used to customize the metric space of the phenotype-driven patient representations, which are composed of a set of phenotypes capturing complex patient health status. Lastly, EDGE eliminates the false-negative supervision signal using an external drug-disease knowledge base. We evaluate EDGE on two real-world datasets: the public EHR data (MIMIC-IV) and private industrial claims data. Results show that EDGE achieves 7.3% improvement on the ROC-AUC score over the best baseline.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2023,Interval Bound Interpolation for Few-shot Learning with Few Tasks,"Few-shot learning aims to transfer the knowledge acquired from training on a diverse set of tasks to unseen tasks from the same task distribution, with a limited amount of labeled data. The underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good representation of the task manifold. This becomes more difficult when only a limited number of tasks are available for training. In such a few-task few-shot setting, it is beneficial to explicitly preserve the local neighborhoods from the task manifold and exploit this to generate artificial tasks for training. To this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective bounds. We then use a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective interval bounds. We apply our framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains in comparison to recent methods.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2023,Cross-Quality Few-Shot Transfer for Alloy Yield Strength Prediction: A New Material Science Benchmark and An Integrated Optimization Framework,"Discovering high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with high yield strength is an important yet challenging task in material science. However, the yield strength can only be accurately measured by very expensive and time-consuming real-world experiments, hence cannot be acquired at scale. Learning-based methods could facilitate the discovery process, but the lack of a comprehensive dataset on HEA yield strength has created barriers. We present X-Yield, a large-scale material science benchmark with 240 experimentally measured (""high-quality"") and over 100K simulated (imperfect or ""low-quality"") HEA yield strength annotations. Due to the scarcity of experimental annotations and the quality gap in imperfectly simulated data, existing transfer learning methods cannot generalize well on our dataset. We address this cross-quality few-shot transfer problem by leveraging model sparsification ""twice"" --- as a noise-robust feature learning regularizer at the pre-training stage, and as a data-efficient learning regularizer at the few-shot transfer stage. While the workflow already performs decently with ad-hoc sparsity patterns tuned independently for either stage, we take a step further by proposing a bi-level optimization framework termed Bi-RPT, that jointly learns optimal masks and automatically allocates sparsity levels for both stages. The optimization problem is solved efficiently using gradient unrolling, which is seamlessly integrated with the training process. The effectiveness of Bi-RPT is validated through extensive experiments on our new challenging X-Yield dataset, alongside other synthesized testbeds. Specifically, we achieve an 8.9~19.8% reduction in terms of the test mean squared error and 0.98~1.53% in terms of test accuracy, merely using 5-10% of the experimental data.

ICLR,2023,Model ensemble instead of prompt fusion: a sample-specific knowledge transfer method for few-shot prompt tuning,"Prompt tuning approaches, which learn task-specific soft prompts for a downstream task conditioning on frozen pre-trained models, have attracted growing interest due to its parameter efficiency. With large language models and sufficient training data, prompt tuning performs comparably to full-model tuning. However, with limited training samples in few-shot settings, prompt tuning fails to match the performance of full-model fine-tuning. In this work, we focus on improving the few-shot performance of prompt tuning by transferring knowledge from soft prompts of source tasks with abundant training samples. Recognizing the good generalization capabilities of ensemble methods in low-data regime, we first experiment and show that a simple ensemble of model predictions based on different source prompts, outperforms existing multi-prompt knowledge transfer approaches such as source prompt fusion in the few-shot setting. Motivated by this observation, we further investigate model ensembles and  propose Sample-specific Ensemble of Source Models (SESoM). SESoM learns to adjust the contribution of each source model for each target sample separately when ensembling source model outputs. Through this way, SESoM inherits the superior generalization of ensemble methods and simultaneously captures the sample-specific competence of each source prompt.  We conduct experiments across a diverse set of eight NLP tasks using models of different scales (T5-\{base, large, XL\}) and find that SESoM consistently outperforms the existing models of the same as well as larger parametric scale by a large margin.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2023,Sequential Latent Variable Models for Few-Shot High-Dimensional Time-Series Forecasting,"Modern applications increasingly require learning and forecasting latent dynamics from high-dimensional time-series. Compared to univariate time-series forecasting, this adds a new challenge of reasoning about the latent dynamics of an unobserved abstract state. Sequential latent variable models (LVMs) present an attractive solution, although existing works either struggle with long-term forecasting or have difficulty learning across diverse dynamics. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework of sequential LVMs to unify existing works, contrast their fundamental limitations, and identify an intuitive solution to long-term forecasting for diverse dynamics via meta-learning. We then present the first framework of few-shot forecasting for high-dimensional time-series: instead of learning a single dynamic function, we leverage data of diverse dynamics and learn to adapt latent dynamic functions to few-shot support series. This is realized via Bayesian meta-learning underpinned by: 1) a latent dynamic function conditioned on knowledge derived from few-shot support series, and 2) a meta-model that learns to extract such dynamic-specific knowledge via feed-forward embedding of support set. We compared the presented framework with a comprehensive set of baseline models trained 1) globally on the large meta-training set with diverse dynamics, and 2) individually on single dynamics, both with and without fine-tuning to k-shot support series used by the meta-models. We demonstrated that the presented framework is agnostic to the latent dynamic function of choice and, at meta-test time, is able to forecast for new dynamics given variable-shot of support series.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Uncertainty-Aware Meta-Learning for Multimodal Task Distributions,"Meta-learning or learning to learn is a popular approach for learning new tasks with limited data (i.e., few-shot learning) by leveraging the commonalities among different tasks. However, meta-learned models can perform poorly when context data is limited, or when data is drawn from an out-of-distribution (OoD) task. Especially in safety-critical settings, this necessitates an uncertainty-aware approach to meta-learning. In addition, the often multimodal nature of task distributions can pose unique challenges to meta-learning methods. In this work, we present UnLiMTD (Uncertainty-aware meta-Learning for Multimodal Task Distributions), a novel method for meta-learning that (1) makes probabilistic predictions on in-distribution tasks efficiently, (2) is capable of detecting OoD context data at test time, and (3) performs on heterogeneous, multimodal task distributions. To achieve this goal, we take a probabilistic perspective and train a parametric, tuneable distribution over tasks on the meta-dataset. We construct this distribution by performing Bayesian inference on a linearized neural network, leveraging Gaussian process theory. We demonstrate that UnLiMTD’s predictions compare to, and outperform in most cases, the standard baselines, especially in the low-data regime. Furthermore, we show that UnLiMTD is effective in detecting data from OoD tasks. Finally, we confirm that both of these findings continue to hold in the multimodal task-distribution setting.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全

On the other hand, models pre-trained with large-scale text supervision (e.g., CLIP) have enabled zero-shot transfer to downstream image classification tasks. However, the zero-shot performance of CLIP-like models are often insufficient for real-world adoption. In this paper, we aim to leverage the abundant unlabeled data from a target domain to improve the performance of a pre-trained zero-shot classifier, by unsupervised finetuning of the pre-trained model. We propose Masked Unsupervised Self-Training (MUST), a new approach which leverages two different and complimentary sources of training signals: pseudo-labels and raw images. MUST jointly optimizes three objectives to learn both class-level global feature and pixel-level local feature and enforces a regularization between the two. We demonstrate the efficacy of MUST on 8 downstream tasks across a variety of domains, where it improves upon CLIP by a large margin. MUST also outperforms supervised few-shot adaptation methods. It achieves a top-1 accuracy of 77.7% on ImageNet using ViT-B, +9.4% higher than CLIP, and +6.2% higher than 16-shot CLIP adaptation.

ICLR,2023,"A Minimalist Dataset for Systematic Generalization of Perception, Syntax, and Semantics","Inspired by humans' exceptional ability to master arithmetic and generalize to new problems, we present a new dataset, HINT, to examine machines' capability of learning generalizable concepts at three levels: perception, syntax, and semantics. In HINT, machines are tasked with learning how concepts are perceived from raw signals such as images (i.e., perception), how multiple concepts are structurally combined to form a valid expression (i.e., syntax), and how concepts are realized to afford various reasoning tasks (i.e., semantics), all in a weakly supervised manner. Focusing on systematic generalization, we carefully design a five-fold test set to evaluate both the interpolation and the extrapolation of learned concepts w.r.t the three levels. Further, we design a few-shot learning split to determine whether or not models can rapidly learn new concepts and generalize them to more complex scenarios. To comprehend existing models' limitations, we undertake extensive experiments with various sequence-to-sequence models, including RNNs, Transformers, and GPT-3 (with the chain of thought prompting). The results indicate that current models struggle to extrapolate to long-range syntactic dependency and semantics. Models exhibit a considerable gap toward human-level generalization when evaluated with new concepts in a few-shot setting. Moreover, we discover that it is infeasible to solve HINT by merely scaling up the dataset and the model size; this strategy contributes little to the extrapolation of syntax and semantics. Finally, in zero-shot GPT-3 experiments, the chain of thought prompting exhibits impressive results and significantly boosts the test accuracy. We believe the HINT dataset and the experimental findings are of great interest to the learning community on systematic generalization.%",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,FiT: Parameter Efficient Few-shot Transfer Learning for Personalized and Federated Image Classification,"Modern deep learning systems are increasingly deployed in situations such as personalization and federated learning where it is necessary to support i) learning on small amounts of data, and ii) communication efficient distributed training protocols. In this work, we develop FiLM Transfer (FiT) which fulfills these requirements in the image classification setting by combining ideas from transfer learning (fixed pretrained backbones and fine-tuned FiLM adapter layers) and meta-learning (automatically configured Naive Bayes classifiers and episodic training) to yield parameter efficient models with superior classification accuracy at low-shot. The resulting parameter efficiency is key for enabling few-shot learning, inexpensive model updates for personalization, and communication efficient federated learning. We experiment with FiT on a wide range of downstream datasets and show that it achieves better classification accuracy than the leading Big Transfer (BiT) algorithm at low-shot and achieves state-of-the art accuracy on the challenging VTAB-1k benchmark, with fewer than 1% of the updateable parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the parameter efficiency and superior accuracy of FiT in distributed low-shot applications including model personalization and federated learning where model update size is an important performance metric.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,Correcting Data Distribution Mismatch in Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Few-Shot Online Adaptation,"Offline meta-reinforcement learning (offline meta-RL) extracts knowledge from a given dataset of multiple tasks and achieves fast adaptation to new tasks. Recent offline meta-RL methods typically use task-dependent behavior policies (e.g., training RL agents on each individual task) to collect a multi-task dataset and learn an offline meta-policy. However, these methods always require extra information for fast adaptation, such as offline context for testing tasks or oracle reward functions. Offline meta-RL with few-shot online adaptation remains an open problem. In this paper, we first formally characterize a unique challenge under this setting: data distribution mismatch between offline training and online adaptation. This distribution mismatch may lead to unreliable offline policy evaluation and the regular adaptation methods of online meta-RL will suffer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel mechanism of data distribution correction, which ensures the consistency between offline and online evaluation by filtering out out-of-distribution episodes in online adaptation. As few-shot out-of-distribution episodes usually have lower returns, we propose a Greedy Context-based data distribution Correction approach, called GCC, which greedily infers how to solve new tasks. GCC diversely samples “task hypotheses” from the current posterior belief and selects a greedy hypothesis with the highest return to update the task belief. Our method is the first to provide an effective online adaptation without additional information, and can be combined with off-the-shelf context-based offline meta-training algorithms. Empirical experiments show that GCC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Meta-World ML1 benchmark compared to baselines with/without offline adaptation.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,"Universal embodied intelligence: learning from crowd, recognizing the world, and reinforced with experience","The interactive artificial intelligence in the motion control field is an interesting topic, especially when universal knowledge adaptive to multiple task and universal environments is wanted. Although there are increasing efforts on Reinforcement learning (RL) studies with the assistance of transformers, it might subject to the limitation of the offline training pipeline, in which the exploration and generalization ability is prohibited. Motivated by the cognitive and behavioral psychology, such agent should have the ability to learn from others, recognize the world, and practice itself based its own experience. In this study, we propose the framework of Online Decision MetaMorphFormer (ODM) which attempts to achieve the above learning modes, with a unified model architecture to both highlight its own body perception and produce action and observation predictions. ODM can be applied on any arbitrary agent with a multi-joint body, located in different environments, trained with different type of tasks. Large-scale pretrained dataset are used to warmup ODM while the targeted environment continues to reinforce the universal policy. Substantial interactive experiments as well as few-shot and zero-shot tests in unseen environments and never-experienced tasks verify ODM's performance, and generalization ability. Our study shed some lights on research of general artificial intelligence on the embodied and cognitive field studies.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Selective Annotation Makes Language Models Better Few-Shot Learners,"Many recent approaches to natural language tasks are built on the remarkable abilities of large language models. Large language models can perform in-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task demonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the implications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new natural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we formulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets (covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code generation) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task performance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4% relative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly selecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised finetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less annotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our framework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative selective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain shift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as large language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Planning Immediate Landmarks of Targets for Model-Free Skill Transfer across Agents,"In reinforcement learning applications, agents usually need to deal with various input/output features when specified with different state and action spaces by their developers or physical restrictions, indicating re-training from scratch and considerable sample inefficiency, especially when agents follow similar solution steps to achieve tasks.
In this paper, we aim to transfer pre-trained skills to alleviate the above challenge. Specifically, we propose PILoT, i.e., Planning Immediate Landmarks of Targets. PILoT utilizes the universal decoupled policy optimization to learn a goal-conditioned state planner; then, we distill a goal-planner to plan immediate landmarks in a model-free style that can be shared among different agents. In our experiments, we show the power of PILoT on various transferring challenges, including few-shot transferring across action spaces and dynamics, from low-dimensional vector states to image inputs, from simple robot to complicated morphology; and we also illustrate PILoT provides a zero-shot transfer solution from a simple 2D navigation task to the harder Ant-Maze task.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2023,Meta-learning Adaptive Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes for Molecular Property Prediction,"We propose Adaptive Deep Kernel Fitting with Implicit Function Theorem (ADKF-IFT), a novel framework for learning deep kernel Gaussian processes (GPs) by interpolating between meta-learning and conventional deep kernel learning. Our approach employs a bilevel optimization objective where we meta-learn generally useful feature representations across tasks, in the sense that task-specific GP models estimated on top of such features achieve the lowest possible predictive loss on average. We solve the resulting nested optimization problem using the implicit function theorem (IFT). We show that our ADKF-IFT framework contains previously proposed Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) and Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT) as special cases. Although ADKF-IFT is a completely general method, we argue that it is especially well-suited for drug discovery problems and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on a variety of real-world few-shot molecular property prediction tasks and out-of-domain molecular property prediction and optimization tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2023,PLOT: Prompt Learning with Optimal Transport for Vision-Language Models,"With the increasing attention to large vision-language models such as CLIP, there has been a significant amount of effort dedicated to building efficient prompts. Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data. Extensive experiments are conducted on the few-shot recognition task and the improvement demonstrates the superiority of our method.

ICLR,2023,Few-Shot Transferable Robust Representation Learning via Bilevel Attacks,"Existing adversarial learning methods for enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks assume the availability of a large amount of data from which we can generate adversarial examples. However, in an adversarial meta-learning setting, the model needs to train with only a few adversarial examples to learn a robust model for unseen tasks, which is a very difficult goal to achieve. Further, learning transferable robust representations for unseen domains is a difficult problem even with a large amount of data. To tackle such a challenge, we propose a novel adversarial self-supervised meta-learning framework with bilevel attacks which aims to learn robust representations that can generalize across tasks and domains. Specifically, in the inner loop, we update the parameters of the given encoder by taking inner gradient steps using two different sets of augmented samples, and generate adversarial examples for each view by maximizing the instance classification loss. Then, in the outer loop, we meta-learn the encoder parameter to maximize the agreement between the two adversarial examples, which enables it to learn robust representations. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach on unseen domain adaptation tasks, on which it achieves impressive performance. Specifically, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art meta-adversarial learning methods on few-shot learning tasks, as well as self-supervised learning baselines in standard learning settings with large-scale datasets.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2023,Dynamic Prompt Learning via Policy Gradient for Semi-structured Mathematical Reasoning,"Mathematical reasoning, a core ability of human intelligence, presents unique challenges for machines in abstract thinking and logical reasoning. Recent large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have achieved remarkable progress on mathematical reasoning tasks written in text form, such as math word problems (MWP). However, it is unknown if the models can handle more complex problems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information, such as tabular data. To fill the gap, we present Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP), a new dataset containing 38,431 open-domain grade-level problems that require mathematical reasoning on both textual and tabular data. Each question in TabMWP is aligned with a tabular context, which is presented as an image, semi-structured text, and a structured table. There are two types of questions: free-text and multi-choice, and each problem is annotated with gold solutions to reveal the multi-step reasoning process. We evaluate different pre-trained models on TabMWP, including the GPT-3 model in a few-shot setting. As earlier studies suggest, since few-shot GPT-3 relies on the selection of in-context examples, its performance is unstable and can degrade to near chance. The unstable issue is more severe when handling complex problems like TabMWP. To mitigate this, we further propose a novel approach, PromptPG, which utilizes policy gradient to learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data and then constructs the corresponding prompt for the test example. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by 5.31% on the accuracy metric and reduces the prediction variance significantly compared to random selection, which verifies its effectiveness in selecting in-context examples.

ICLR,2023,TempCLR: Temporal Alignment Representation with Contrastive Learning,"Video representation learning has been successful in video-text pre-training for zero-shot transfer, where each sentence is trained to be close to the paired video clips in a common feature space. For long videos, given a paragraph of description where the sentences describe different segments of the video, by matching all sentence-clip pairs,  the paragraph and the full video are aligned implicitly. However, such unit-level similarity measure may ignore the global temporal context over a long time span, which inevitably limits the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework TempCLR to compare the full video and the paragraph explicitly. As the video/paragraph is formulated as a sequence of clips/sentences, under the constraint of their temporal order, we use dynamic time warping to compute the minimum cumulative cost over sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To explore the temporal dynamics, we break the consistency of temporal order by shuffling the video clips or sentences according to the temporal granularity. In this way, we obtain the representations for clips/sentences, which perceive the temporal information and thus facilitate the sequence alignment. In addition to pre-training on the video and paragraph, our approach can also generalize on the matching between different video instances. We evaluate our approach on video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition, and achieve consistent performance gain over all three tasks. Detailed ablation studies are provided to justify the approach design.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Neural Radiance Fields with Geometric Consistency for Few-Shot Novel View Synthesis,"We present a novel method to regularizes neural radiance field (NeRF) in few-shot setting with geometry-based consistency regularization. The proposed approach leverages NeRF's rendered depth map to warp source images to unobserved viewpoints and impose them as pseudo ground truths to facilitate learning of detailed features. By encouraging consistency at feature-level instead of using pixel-level reconstruction loss, we regularize the network solely at semantic and structural levels while allowing view-dependent radiance to model freely after color variations. Our application of proposed consistency term for the network is twofold: between and observed and unobserved viewpoints, image rendered at unseen view is forced to model after the image warped from input observation, while between observed viewpoints the warped image undergoes optimization for geometry-specific regularization. We also demonstrate an effective method to filter out erroneous warped solutions, along with relevant techniques to stabilize training during optimization. We show that our model achieves competitive results compared to concurrent few-shot NeRF models.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

By using these benchmarks, we are able to assess the performance of code generation models in a multi-lingual fashion, and discovered generalization ability of language models on out-of-domain languages, advantages of multi-lingual models over mono-lingual, the ability of  few-shot prompting to teach the model new languages, and zero-shot translation abilities.

We perform extensive evaluation with popular language models such as few-shot prompting GPT-3 and fine-tuned T5. We find that these models still lag behind human performance when producing such structured reasoning steps.

ICLR,2023,Neural Collapse Inspired Feature-Classifier Alignment for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning,"Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) has been a challenging problem as only a few training samples are accessible for each novel class in the new sessions. Finetuning the backbone or adjusting the classifier prototypes trained in the prior sessions would inevitably cause a misalignment between the feature and classifier of old classes, which explains the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we deal with this misalignment dilemma in FSCIL inspired by the recently discovered phenomenon named neural collapse, which reveals that the last-layer features of the same class will collapse into a vertex, and the vertices of all classes are aligned with the classifier prototypes, which are formed as a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). It corresponds to an optimal geometric structure for classification due to the maximized Fisher Discriminant Ratio. We propose a neural collapse inspired framework for FSCIL. A group of classifier prototypes are pre-assigned as a simplex ETF for the whole label space, including the base session and all the incremental sessions. During training, the classifier prototypes are not learnable, and we adopt a novel loss function that drives the features into their corresponding prototypes. Theoretical analysis shows that our method holds the neural collapse optimality and does not break the feature-classifier alignment in an incremental fashion. Experiments on the miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.

ICLR,2023,Hierarchical Relational Learning for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine the meta representation of few-shot relations, and consequently generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods.

ICLR,2023,The Devil is in the Wrongly-classified Samples: Towards Unified Open-set Recognition,"Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to identify test samples whose classes are not seen during the training process. Recently, Unified Open-set Recognition (UOSR) has been proposed to reject not only unknown samples but also known but wrongly classified samples, which tends to be more practical in real-world applications. In this paper, we deeply analyze the UOSR task under different training and evaluation settings to shed light on this promising research direction. For this purpose, we first evaluate the UOSR performance of several OSR methods and show a significant finding that the uncertainty distribution of almost all these methods is actually closer to the expectation of UOSR than OSR. We show that the reason lies in the known but wrongly classified samples, as their uncertainty distribution is extremely close to unknown samples rather than known and correctly classified samples. Second, we analyze how the two training settings of OSR (i.e., pre-training and outlier exposure) influence the UOSR. We find although they are both beneficial for distinguishing known and correctly classified samples from unknown samples, pre-training is also helpful for identifying known but wrongly classified samples while outlier exposure is not. In addition to different training settings, we also formulate a new evaluation setting for UOSR which is called few-shot UOSR, where only one or five samples per unknown class are available during evaluation to help identify unknown samples. We propose FS-KNNS for the few-shot UOSR to achieve state-of-the-art performance under all settings.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,EyeDAS: Securing Perception of Autonomous Cars Against the Stereoblindness Syndrome,"The ability to detect whether an object is a 2D or 3D object is extremely important in autonomous driving, since a detection error can have life-threatening consequences, endangering the safety of the driver, passengers, pedestrians, and others on the road. 
Methods proposed to distinguish between 2 and 3D objects (e.g., liveness detection methods) are not suitable for autonomous driving, because they are object dependent or do not consider the constraints associated with autonomous driving (e.g., the need for real-time decision-making while the vehicle is moving).
In this paper, we present EyeDAS, a novel few-shot learning-based method aimed at securing an object detector (OD) against the threat posed by the stereoblindness syndrome (i.e., the inability to distinguish between 2D and 3D objects).
We evaluate EyeDAS's real-time performance using 2,000 objects extracted from seven YouTube video recordings of street views taken by a dash cam from the driver's seat perspective.
When applying EyeDAS to seven state-of-the-art ODs as a countermeasure, EyeDAS was able to reduce the 2D misclassification rate from 71.42-100% to 2.4% with a 3D misclassification rate of 0% (TPR of 1.0).

The classifiers of a multi-stage process are usually Neural Network (NN) models trained independently or in their inference order without considering the signals from the latter stages. Aimed at two-stage binary classification process, the most common type of MSC, we propose a novel training framework, named Feedback Training. The classifiers are trained in an order reverse to their actual working order, and the classifier at the later stage is used to guide the training of initial-stage classifier via a sample weighting method.

ICLR,2023,Cross-Level Distillation and Feature Denoising for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification,"The conventional few-shot classification aims at learning a model on a large labeled base dataset and rapidly adapting to a target dataset that is from the same distribution as the base dataset. However, in practice, the base and the target datasets of few-shot classification are usually from different domains, which is the problem of cross-domain few-shot classification. We tackle this problem by making a small proportion of unlabeled images in the target domain accessible in the training stage. In this setup, even though the base data are sufficient and labeled, the large domain shift still makes transferring the knowledge from the base dataset difficult. We meticulously design a cross-level knowledge distillation method, which can strengthen the ability of the model to extract more discriminative features in the target dataset by guiding the network's shallow layers to learn higher-level information. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the overfitting in the evaluation stage, we propose a feature denoising operation which can reduce the feature redundancy and mitigate overfitting. Our approach can surpass the previous state-of-the-art method, Dynamic-Distillation, by 5.44% on 1-shot and 1.37% on 5-shot classification tasks on average in the BSCD-FSL benchmark.

ICLR,2023,ThinkSum: Probabilistic reasoning over sets using large language models,"Large language models (LLMs) have a substantial capacity for high-level analogical reasoning: reproducing patterns in linear text that occur in their training data (zero-shot evaluation) or in the provided context (few-shot in-context learning). However, recent studies show that even the largest LLMs fail in scenarios that require reasoning over multiple objects or facts or making sequences of logical deductions. We propose a two-stage probabilistic inference paradigm, ThinkSum, that reasons over sets of objects or facts in a structured manner. In the first stage (Think -- 'fast' retrieval of associations), a LLM is queried in parallel over a set of phrases extracted from the prompt or an auxiliary model call. In the second stage (Sum -- 'slow' probabilistic inference or reasoning), the results of these queries are aggregated to make the final prediction. We demonstrate the advantages of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite of evaluation tasks, achieving improvements over the state of the art using GPT-family models on ten difficult tasks, often with far smaller model variants. We compare and contrast ThinkSum with other proposed modifications to direct prompting of LLMs, such as variants of chain-of-thought prompting. We argue that because the probabilistic inference in ThinkSum is performed outside of calls to the LLM, ThinkSum is less sensitive to prompt design, yields more interpretable predictions, and can be flexibly combined with latent variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Suppressing the Heterogeneity: A Strong Feature Extractor for Few-shot Segmentation,"This paper tackles the Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) task with focus on learning the feature extractor. Somehow the feature extractor has been overlooked by recent state-of-the-art methods, which directly use a deep model pretrained on ImageNet for feature extraction (without further fine-tuning). Under this background, we think the FSS feature extractor deserves exploration and observe the heterogeneity (i.e., the intra-class diversity in the raw images) as a critical challenge hindering the intra-class feature compactness. The heterogeneity has three levels from coarse to fine: 1) Sample-level: the inevitable distribution gap between the support and query images makes them heterogeneous from each other. 2) Region-level: the background in FSS actually contains multiple regions with different semantics. 3) Patch-level: some neighboring patches belonging to a same class may appear quite different from each other. Motivated by these observations, we propose a feature extractor with Multi-level Heterogeneity Suppressing (MuHS). MuHS leverages the attention mechanism in transformer backbone to effectively suppress all these three-level heterogeneity. Concretely, MuHS reinforces the attention / interaction between different samples (query and support), different regions and neighboring patches by constructing cross-sample attention, cross-region interaction and a novel masked image segmentation (inspired by the recent masked image modeling), respectively. We empirically show that 1) MuHS brings consistent improvement for various FSS heads and 2) using a simple linear classification head, MuHS sets new states of the art on multiple FSS datasets, validating the importance of FSS feature learning.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2023,Pushing the Limits of Fewshot Anomaly Detection in Industry Vision: Graphcore,"In the area of few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD), efficient visual feature plays an essential role in the memory bank $\mathcal{M}$-based methods. However, these methods do not account for the relationship between the visual feature and its rotated visual feature, drastically limiting the anomaly detection performance. To push the limits, we reveal that rotation-invariant feature property has a significant impact on industrial-based FSAD. Specifically, we utilize graph representation in FSAD and provide a novel visual isometric invariant feature (VIIF) as an anomaly measurement feature. As a result, VIIF can robustly improve the anomaly discriminating ability and can further reduce the size of redundant features stored in $\mathcal{M}$ by a large amount. Besides, we provide a novel model GraphCore via VIIFs that can fast implement unsupervised FSAD training and improve the performance of anomaly detection. A comprehensive evaluation is provided for comparing GraphCore and other SOTA anomaly detection models under our proposed few-shot anomaly detection setting, which shows GraphCore can increase average AUC by 5.8%, 4.1%, 3.4%, and 1.6% on MVTec AD and by 25.5%, 22.0%, 16.9%, and 14.1% on MPDD for 1, 2, 4, and 8-shot cases, respectively.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2023,Neural Attention Memory,"Scaled dot-product attention has become the essence of state-of-the-art deep neural networks for various machine learning tasks. Though its ubiquitous accomplishments, it is inefficient for long sequence tasks and problematic for tasks requiring memory states such as compositional generalization. We propose a novel perspective of the attention mechanism by reinventing it as a memory architecture for neural networks, namely Neural Attention Memory (NAM). NAM follows the same query-key-value structure by constructing a memory matrix while reducing its computational complexity from quadratic to linear to the sequence length. NAM writes a memory matrix via the sum of outer products of value and unit key vectors, and reads it by multiplying the matrix with a unit query vector. Indeed, we show that our normalized outer-product attention mechanism is mathematically equivalent to the conventional attention mechanism. Then, we evaluate a NAM-based Transformer on long-range arena tasks and demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we propose two NAM-based memory-augmented neural networks, namely Long Short-Term Attention Memory (LSAM) and NAM Turing Machine (NAM-TM), and test their compositional generalization capability using four different tasks. LSAM replaces LSTM's long-term cell state with NAM memory matrix and NAM-TM implements a Turing tape data structure using NAM read/write primitives. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform traditional Transformer and LSTM, as well as DNC.

ICLR,2023,Model-agnostic Measure of Generalization Difficulty,"The measure of a machine learning algorithm is the difficulty of the tasks it can perform, and sufficiently difficult tasks are critical drivers of strong machine learning models. However, quantifying the generalization difficulty of machine learning benchmarks has remained challenging. We propose what is to our knowledge the first model-agnostic measure of the inherent generalization difficulty of tasks. Our inductive bias complexity measure quantifies the total information required to generalize well on a task minus the information provided by the data. It does so by measuring the fractional volume occupied by hypotheses that generalize on a task given that they fit the training data. It scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimensionality of the space over which the model must generalize but only polynomially in resolution per dimension, showing that tasks which require generalizing over many dimensions are drastically more difficult than tasks involving more detail in fewer dimensions. Our measure can be applied to compute and compare supervised learning, reinforcement learning and meta-learning task difficulties against each other. We show that applied empirically, it formally quantifies intuitively expected trends, e.g. that in terms of required inductive bias, MNIST $<$ CIFAR10 $<$ Imagenet and fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs) $<$ partially observable MDPs. Further, we show that classification of complex images $<$ few-shot meta-learning with simple images. Our measure provides a quantitative metric to guide the construction of more complex tasks requiring greater inductive bias, and thereby encourages the development of more sophisticated architectures and learning algorithms with more powerful generalization capabilities.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,In-context Autoencoder for Context Compression in a Large Language Model,"We propose the In-context Autoencoder (ICAE), leveraging the power of a large language model (LLM) to compress a long context into short compact memory slots that can be directly conditioned on by the LLM for various purposes. ICAE is first pretrained using both autoencoding and language modeling objectives on massive text data, enabling it to generate memory slots that accurately and comprehensively represent the original context. Then, it is fine-tuned on instruction data for producing desirable responses to various prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our lightweight ICAE, introducing about 1% additional parameters, effectively achieves $4\times$ context compression based on Llama, offering advantages in both improved latency and GPU memory cost during inference, and showing an interesting insight in memorization as well as potential for scalability. These promising results imply a novel perspective on the connection between working memory in cognitive science and representation learning in LLMs, revealing ICAE's significant implications in addressing the long context problem and suggesting further research in LLM context management.

ICLR,2024,In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism,"In-context learning (ICL) is one of the surprising and useful features of large language models and subject of intense research. Recently, stylized meta-learning-like ICL setups have been devised that train transformers on sequences of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$. The function $f$ comes from a function class and generalization is checked by evaluating on sequences generated from unseen functions from the same class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been that for several function classes, such as linear regression, transformers successfully generalize to new functions in the class. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining distribution.
In this paper we empirically examine how far this Bayesian perspective can help us understand ICL. To this end, we generalize the previous meta-ICL setup to hierarchical meta-ICL setup which involve unions of multiple task families. We instantiate this setup on a diverse range of linear and nonlinear function families and find that transformers can do ICL in this setting as well. Where Bayesian inference is tractable, we find evidence that high-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor. The Bayesian perspective provides insights into the inductive bias of ICL and how transformers perform a particular task when they are trained on multiple tasks. We also find that transformers can learn to generalize to new function classes that were not seen during pretraining. This involves deviation from the Bayesian predictor. We examine these deviations in more depth offering new insights and hypotheses.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,Retrieval meets Long Context Large Language Models,"Extending the context window of large language models (LLMs) is getting popular recently, while the solution of augmenting LLMs with retrieval has existed for years. The natural questions are: i) Retrieval-augmentation versus long context window, which one is better for downstream tasks? ii) Can both methods be combined to get the best of both worlds? In this work, we answer these questions by studying both solutions using two state-of-the-art pretrained LLMs, i.e., a proprietary 43B GPT and Llama2-70B. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that LLM with 4K context window using simple retrieval-augmentation at generation can achieve comparable performance to finetuned LLM with 16K context window via positional interpolation on long context tasks, while taking much less computation. More importantly, we demonstrate that retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes. Our best model, retrieval-augmented Llama2-70B with 32K context window, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k and Davinci003 in terms of average score on nine long context tasks including question answering, query-based summarization, and in-context few-shot learning tasks. It also outperforms its non-retrieval Llama2-70B-32k baseline by a margin, while being much faster at generation. Our study provides general insights on the choice of retrieval-augmentation versus long context extension of LLM for practitioners.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,Kosmos-G: Generating Images in Context with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Recent advancements in subject-driven image generation have made significant strides. However, current methods still fall short in diverse application scenarios, as they require test-time tuning and cannot accept interleaved multi-image and text input. These limitations keep them far from the ultimate goal of ""image as a foreign language in image generation."" This paper presents Kosmos-G, a model that leverages the advanced multimodal perception capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle the aforementioned challenge. Our approach aligns the output space of MLLM with CLIP using the textual modality as an anchor and performs compositional instruction tuning on curated data. Kosmos-G demonstrates an impressive capability of zero-shot subject-driven generation with interleaved multi-image and text input. Notably, the score distillation instruction tuning requires no modifications to the image decoder. This allows for a seamless substitution of CLIP and effortless integration with a myriad of U-Net techniques ranging from fine-grained controls to personalized image decoder variants. We posit Kosmos-G as an initial attempt towards the goal of ""image as a foreign language in image generation.""",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,RECOMP: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LMs with Context Compression and Selective Augmentation,"Retrieval-augmented language models improve language models (LMs) by retrieving documents and prepending them in-context.
However, these documents, often spanning hundreds of words, make inference substantially less efficient. We propose compressing the retrieved documents into textual summaries prior to in-context integration. This not only reduces the computational costs but also relieve the burden of LMs to identify relevant information in long retrieved documents. We present two compressors -- an extractive compressor which selects useful sentences from retrieved documents  and an abstractive compressor which generates summary by synthesizing information from multiple documents. Both are trained to achieve performance gain in LMs when we prepend the generated summary from the compressor to LMs' input, while minimizing the summary length. When retrieved documents are irrelevant to the input or offer no additional information to LM, our compressors output an empty string, enabling selective augmentation. We evaluate our approach on the language modeling task and open domain question answering task. We achieve a compression rate of as low as 6% with minimal loss in performance for both tasks, significantly outperforming the off-the-shelf summarization models. We show that our compressors trained for one LM can transfer to other LMs on the language modeling task and provide a summary largely faithful to the retrieved documents.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,Gen-Z: Generative Zero-Shot Text Classification with Contextualized Label Descriptions,"Language model (LM) prompting—a popular paradigm for solving NLP tasks—has been shown to be susceptible to miscalibration and brittleness to slight prompt variations, caused by its discriminative prompting approach, i.e., predicting the label given the input. To address these issues, we propose Gen-Z—a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. GEN-Z is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,In-Context Learning Dynamics with Random Binary Sequences,"Large language models (LLMs) trained on huge text datasets demonstrate intriguing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained for. The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs’ behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Enhancing Instance-Level Image Classification with Set-Level Labels,"Instance-level image classification tasks have traditionally relied on single-instance labels to train models, e.g., few-shot learning and transfer learning. However, set-level coarse-grained labels that capture relationships among instances can provide richer information in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance instance-level image classification by leveraging set-level labels. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including recognition conditions for fast excess risk rate, shedding light on the theoretical foundations of our approach. We conducted experiments on two distinct categories of datasets: natural image datasets and histopathology image datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing improved classification performance compared to traditional single-instance label-based methods. Notably, our algorithm achieves 13\% improvement in classification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline on the histopathology image classification benchmarks. Importantly, our experimental findings align with the theoretical analysis, reinforcing the robustness and reliability of our proposed method. This work bridges the gap between instance-level and set-level image classification, offering a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of image classification models with set-level coarse-grained labels.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2024,AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents,"We introduce AMAGO, an in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that uses sequence models to tackle the challenges of generalization, long-term memory, and meta-learning. Recent works have shown that off-policy learning can make in-context RL with recurrent policies viable. Nonetheless, these approaches require extensive tuning and limit scalability by creating key bottlenecks in agents' memory capacity, planning horizon, and model size. AMAGO revisits and redesigns the off-policy in-context approach to successfully train long-sequence Transformers over entire rollouts in parallel with end-to-end RL. Our agent is scalable and applicable to a wide range of problems, and we demonstrate its strong performance empirically in meta-RL and long-term memory domains. AMAGO's focus on sparse rewards and off-policy data also allows in-context learning to extend to goal-conditioned problems with challenging exploration. When combined with a multi-goal hindsight relabeling scheme, AMAGO can solve a previously difficult category of open-world domains, where agents complete many possible instructions in procedurally generated environments.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2024,Understanding In-Context Learning in Transformers and LLMs by Learning to Learn Discrete Functions,"In order to understand the in-context learning phenomenon, recent works have adopted a stylized experimental framework and demonstrated that Transformers can match the performance of gradient-based learning algorithms for various classes of real-valued functions. However, the limitations of Transformers in implementing learning algorithms, and their ability to learn other forms of algorithms are not well understood. Additionally, the degree to which these capabilities are confined to attention-based models is unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether the insights derived from these stylized settings can be extrapolated to pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we take a step towards answering these questions by demonstrating the following: (a) On a test-bed with a variety of Boolean function classes, we find that Transformers can nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for 'simpler' tasks, while their performance deteriorates on more 'complex' tasks. Additionally, we find that certain attention-free models perform (almost) identically to Transformers on a range of tasks. (b) When provided a *teaching sequence*, i.e. a set of examples that uniquely identifies a function in a class, we show that Transformers learn more sample-efficiently. Interestingly, our results show that Transformers can learn to implement *two distinct* algorithms to solve a *single* task, and can adaptively select the more sample-efficient algorithm depending on the sequence of in-context examples. (c) Lastly, we show that extant LLMs, e.g. LLaMA-2, GPT-4, can compete with nearest-neighbor baselines on prediction tasks that are guaranteed to not be in their training set.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,The mechanistic basis of data dependence and abrupt learning in an in-context classification task,"Transformer models exhibit in-context learning: the ability to accurately predict the response to a novel query based on illustrative examples in the input sequence, which contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data distribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent work has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language, such as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions, control the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of learning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal attention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning (ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which subsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress measures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we construct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full data distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A phenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence to the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic curriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks arise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve ICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during training.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Overthinking the Truth: Understanding how Language Models Process False Demonstrations,"Modern language models can imitate complex patterns through few-shot learning, enabling them to complete challenging tasks without fine-tuning. However, imitation can also lead models to reproduce inaccuracies or harmful content if present in the context. We study harmful imitation through the lens of a model’s internal representations, and identify two related phenomena: overthinking and false induction heads. The first phenomenon, overthinking, appears when we decode predictions from intermediate layers, given correct vs. incorrect few-shot demonstrations. At early layers, both demonstrations induce similar model behavior, but the behavior diverges sharply at some “critical layer”, after which the accuracy given incorrect demonstrations progressively decreases. The second phenomenon, false induction heads, are a possible mechanistic cause of overthinking: these are heads in late layers that attend to and copy false information from previous demonstrations, and whose ablation reduces overthinking. Beyond scientific understanding, our results suggest that studying intermediate model computations could be a promising avenue for understanding and guarding against harmful model behaviors.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,Does CLIP’s generalization performance mainly stem from high train-test similarity?,"Foundation models like CLIP are trained on hundreds of millions of samples and effortlessly generalize to new tasks and inputs. Out of the box, CLIP shows stellar zero-shot and few-shot capabilities on a wide range of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, which prior works attribute mainly to today's large and comprehensive training dataset (like LAION). However, it is questionable how meaningful terms like out-of-distribution generalization are for CLIP as it seems likely that web-scale datasets like LAION simply contain many samples that are similar to common OOD benchmarks originally designed for ImageNet. To test this hypothesis, we retrain CLIP on pruned LAION splits that replicate ImageNet’s train-test similarity with respect to common OOD benchmarks. While we observe a performance drop on some benchmarks, surprisingly, CLIP’s overall performance remains high. This shows that high train-test similarity is insufficient to explain CLIP’s OOD performance, and other properties of the training data must drive CLIP to learn more generalizable representations. Additionally, by pruning data points that are dissimilar to the OOD benchmarks, we uncover a 100M split of LAION (¼ of its original size) on which CLIP can be trained to match its original OOD performance.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Group Preference Optimization: Few-Shot Alignment of Large Language Models,"Many applications of large language models (LLMs), ranging from chatbots to
creative writing, require nuanced subjective judgments that can differ significantly
across different groups. Existing alignment algorithms can be expensive to align
for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data
and computation for real-world use cases. We introduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot manner. In GPO, we augment the base
LLM with an independent transformer module trained to predict the preferences
of a group for the LLM generations. For few-shot learning, we parameterize this
module as an in-context autoregressive transformer and train it via meta-learning
on several groups. We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks. These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic
groups, global countries, and individual users. Our results demonstrate that GPO
not only aligns models more accurately but also requires fewer group-specific
preferences and less training and inference computing resources, outperforming
existing strategies such as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性

However, visual models trained to detect new objects during inference have been unable to replicate this ability, and instead either perform poorly or require meta-training and/or fine-tuning on similar objects. In this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that emulates Large Language Models by learning new visual concepts during inference without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a frozen pre-trained feature extractor, and analogous to in-context learning, recasts meta-learning as sequence modeling over datapoints with known labels and a test datapoint with an unknown label. On 8 out of 11 meta-learning benchmarks, our approach---without meta-training or fine-tuning---exceeds or matches the state-of-the-art algorithm, P>M>F, which is meta-trained on these benchmarks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,Large Language Models to Enhance Bayesian Optimization,"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach for optimizing complex and expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Its importance is underscored in many applications, notably including hyperparameter tuning, but its efficacy depends on efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation. While there has been substantial progress in BO methods, striking this balance remains a delicate process. In this light, we present \texttt{LLAMBO}, a novel approach that integrates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) within BO. At a high level, we frame the BO problem in natural language, enabling LLMs to iteratively \emph{propose} and \emph{evaluate} promising solutions conditioned on historical evaluations. More specifically, we explore how combining contextual understanding, few-shot learning proficiency, and domain knowledge of LLMs can improve model-based BO. Our findings illustrate that \texttt{LLAMBO} is effective at zero-shot warmstarting, and enhances surrogate modeling and candidate sampling, especially in the early stages of search when observations are sparse. Our approach is performed in context and does not require LLM finetuning. Additionally, it is modular by design, allowing individual components to be integrated into existing BO frameworks, or function cohesively as an end-to-end method. We empirically validate \texttt{LLAMBO}'s efficacy on the problem of hyperparameter tuning, highlighting strong empirical performance across a range of diverse benchmarks, proprietary, and synthetic tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,Two-stage LLM Fine-tuning with Less Specialization and More Generalization,"Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. 
In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs' general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task.We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization.ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. 
With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of  out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization.
Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of  multi-task training.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,In-Context Pretraining: Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries,"Language models are currently trained to predict tokens given document prefixes, enabling them to zero shot long form generation and prompting-style tasks which can be reduced to document completion. We instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are trained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries. Our approach builds on the fact that current pipelines train by concatenating random sets of shorter documents to create longer context windows; this improves efficiency even though the prior documents provide no signal for predicting the next document. Given this fact, we can do IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING by simply changing the document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly applying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem is challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to maximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data. To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent batches with a graph cover algorithm. Our experiments show IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING offers a scalable and simple approach to significantly enhance LM performance: we see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual reasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%), faithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and retrieval augmentation (+9%).",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,Eureka: Human-Level Reward Design via Coding Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled as high-level semantic planners for sequential decision-making tasks. However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2024,Understanding Catastrophic Forgetting in Language Models via Implicit Inference,"We lack a systematic understanding of the effects of fine-tuning (via methods such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), particularly on tasks outside the narrow fine-tuning distribution. In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the expense of capabilities on other tasks. We hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt and that fine-tuning skews this inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution. To test this, we propose Conjugate Prompting, which artificially makes the task look farther from the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability, and we find that this recovers some of the pretraining capabilities in our synthetic setup. Since real-world fine-tuning distributions are predominantly English, we apply conjugate prompting to recover pretrained capabilities in LLMs by simply translating the prompts to different languages. This allows us to recover in-context learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, natural reasoning capability lost during code fine-tuning, and, more concerningly, harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots like ChatGPT.",📚 Prompt工程与优化

We show, via causal experiments, that LMs' internal activations represent binding information by exhibiting appropriate binding ID vectors at the entity and attribute positions. We further show that binding ID vectors form a subspace and often transfer across tasks. Our results demonstrate that LMs learn interpretable strategies for representing symbolic knowledge in context, and that studying context activations is a fruitful direction for understanding LM cognition.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,A Benchmark for Learning to Translate a New Language from One Grammar Book,"Large language models (LLMs) can perform impressive feats with in-context learning or lightweight finetuning. It is natural to wonder how well these models adapt to genuinely new tasks, but how does one find tasks that are unseen in internet-scale training sets? We turn to a field that is explicitly motivated and bottlenecked by a scarcity of web data: low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), a benchmark for learning to translate between English and Kalamang—a language with less than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web—using several hundred pages of field linguistics reference materials. This task framing is novel in that it asks a model to learn a language from a single human-readable book of grammar explanations, rather than a large mined corpus of in-domain data, more akin to L2 language learning than L1 language acquisition. We demonstrate that baselines using current LLMs are promising but fall short of human performance, achieving 44.7 chrF on Kalamang to English translation and 45.8 chrF on English to Kalamang translation, compared to 51.6 and 57.0 chrF by a human who learned Kalamang from the same reference materials. We hope that MTOB will help measure LLM capabilities along a new dimension, and that the methods developed to solve it could help expand access to language technology for underserved communities by leveraging qualitatively different kinds of data than traditional machine translation.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Enhancing Small Medical Learners with Privacy-preserving Contextual Prompting,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable medical expertise, but data privacy concerns impede their direct use in healthcare environments. Although offering improved data privacy protection, domain-specific small language models (SLMs) often underperform LLMs, emphasizing the need for methods that reduce this performance gap while alleviating privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under $privacy-restricted$ scenarios. Specifically, we mitigate patient privacy issues by extracting keywords from medical data and prompting the LLM to generate a medical knowledge-intensive context by simulating clinicians' thought processes. This context serves as additional input for SLMs, augmenting their decision-making capabilities. Our method significantly enhances performance in both few-shot and full training settings across three medical knowledge-intensive tasks, achieving up to a 22.57% increase in absolute accuracy compared to SLM fine-tuning without context, and sets new state-of-the-art results in two medical tasks within privacy-restricted scenarios.

We establish a statistical task complexity bound for the attention model pretraining, showing that effective pretraining only requires a small number of independent tasks.

The recent progress in large-scale generative models has further expanded their use in real-world language applications. However, the critical challenge of improving the generalizability and factuality of LLMs in natural language understanding and question answering remains under-explored. While previous in-context learning research has focused on enhancing models to adhere to users' specific instructions and quality expectations, and to avoid undesired outputs, little to no work has explored the use of task-specific fine-tuned Language Models (SLMs) to improve LLMs' in-context learning during the inference stage. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a simple yet effective framework that enhances the reliability of LLMs as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution data, 2) elucidates how LLMs benefit from discriminative models, and 3) minimizes hallucinations in generative tasks. Using our proposed plug-in method, enhanced versions of Llama 2 and ChatGPT surpass their original versions regarding generalizability and factuality.

However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples.

ICLR,2024,CABINET: Content Relevance-based Noise Reduction for Table Question Answering,"Table understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been extensively studied through the task of question-answering (QA) over tables. Typically, only a small part of the whole table is relevant to derive the answer for a given question. The irrelevant parts act as noise and are distracting information, resulting in sub-optimal performance due to the vulnerability of LLMs to noise. To mitigate this, we propose CABINET (Content RelevAnce-Based NoIse ReductioN for TablE QuesTion-Answering) – a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information. CABINET comprises an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS), trained differentially with the QA LLM, that weighs the table content based on its relevance to the input question before feeding it to the question answering LLM (QA LLM). To further aid the relevance scorer, CABINET employs a weakly supervised module that generates a parsing statement describing the criteria of rows and columns relevant to the question and highlights the content of corresponding table cells.

ICLR,2024,One Step of Gradient Descent is Provably the Optimal In-Context Learner with One Layer of Linear Self-Attention,"Recent works have empirically analyzed in-context learning and shown that transformers trained on synthetic linear regression tasks can learn to implement ridge regression, which is the Bayes-optimal predictor, given sufficient capacity (Akyurek et al., 2023), while one-layer transformers with linear self-attention and no MLP layer will learn to implement one step of gradient descent (GD) on a least-squares linear regression objective (von Oswald et al., 2022). However, the theory behind these observations remains poorly understood. We theoretically study transformers with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. First, we mathematically show that when the covariates are drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer which minimizes the pre-training loss will implement a single step of GD on the least-squares linear regression objective. Then, we find that changing the distribution of the covariates and weight vector to a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution has a strong impact on the learned algorithm: the global minimizer of the pre-training loss now implements a single step of $\textit{pre-conditioned}$ GD. However, if only the distribution of the responses is changed, then this does not have a large effect on the learned algorithm: even when the response comes from a more general family of $\textit{nonlinear}$ functions, the global minimizer of the pre-training loss still implements a single step of GD on a least-squares linear regression objective.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,MetaCoCo: A New Few-Shot Classification Benchmark with Spurious Correlation,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) problems in few-shot classification (FSC) occur when novel classes sampled from testing distributions differ from base classes drawn from training distributions, which considerably degrades the performance of deep learning models deployed in real-world applications. Recent studies suggest that the OOD problems in FSC mainly including: (a) cross-domain few-shot classification (CD-FSC) and (b) spurious-correlation few-shot classification (SC-FSC). Specifically, CD-FSC occurs when a classifier learns transferring knowledge from base classes drawn from \underline{seen} training distributions but recognizes novel classes sampled from unseen testing distributions. In contrast, SC-FSC arises when a classifier relies on non-causal features (or contexts) that happen to be correlated with the labels (or concepts) in base classes but such relationships no longer hold during the model deployment. Despite CD-FSC has been extensively studied, SC-FSC remains understudied due to lack of the corresponding evaluation benchmarks. To this end, we present Meta Concept Context (MetaCoCo), a benchmark with spurious-correlation shifts collected from real-world scenarios. Moreover, to quantify the extent of spurious-correlation shifts of the presented MetaCoCo, we further propose a metric by using CLIP as a pre-trained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are performed to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in FSC, cross-domain shifts, and self-supervised learning. The experimental results show that the performance of the existing methods degrades significantly in the presence of spurious-correlation shifts. We open-source all codes of our benchmark and hope that the proposed MetaCoCo can facilitate future research on spurious-correlation shifts problems in FSC.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Looped Transformers are Better at Learning Learning Algorithms,"Transformers have demonstrated effectiveness in in-context solving data-fitting problems from various (latent) models, as reported by Garg et al. (2022). However, the absence of an inherent iterative structure in the transformer architecture presents a challenge in emulating the iterative algorithms, which are commonly employed in traditional machine learning methods. To address this, we propose the utilization of looped transformer architecture and its associated training methodology, with the aim of incorporating iterative characteristics into the transformer architectures. Experimental results suggest that the looped transformer achieves performance comparable to the standard transformer in solving various data-fitting problems, while utilizing less than 10% of the parameter count.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Is attention required for ICL? Exploring the Relationship Between Model Architecture and In-Context Learning Ability,"What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability to perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather than leverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or better in-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecture demonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauing or declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-context examples than those encountered during gradient-based training.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,GENOME: Generative Neuro-Symbolic Visual Reasoning by Growing and Reusing Modules,"Recent works have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) could empower traditional neuro-symbolic models via programming capabilities to translate languages into module descriptions, thus achieving strong visual reasoning results while maintaining the model’s transparency and efficiency. However, these models usually exhaustively generate the entire code snippet given each new instance of a task, which is extremely ineffective. On the contrary, human beings gradually acquire knowledge that can be reused and grow into more profound skills for fast generalization to new tasks since we are an infant. Inspired by this, we propose generative neuro-symbolic visual reasoning by growing and reusing modules. Specifically, our model consists of three unique stages, module initialization, module generation, and module execution. First, given a vision-language task, we adopt LLMs to examine whether we could reuse and grow over established modules to handle this new task. If not, we initialize a new module needed by the task and specify the inputs and outputs of this new module. After that, the new module is created by querying LLMs to generate corresponding code snippets that match the requirements. In order to get a better sense of the new module’s ability, we treat few-shot training examples as test cases to see if our new module could pass these cases. If yes, the new module is added to the module library for future reuse. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our model on the testing set by executing the parsed programs with the newly made visual modules to get the results. We find the proposed GENOME model possesses several advantages. First, it performs competitively on standard tasks like visual question answering and referring expression comprehension; Second, the visual modules learned from one task can be seamlessly transferred to new tasks; Last but not least, it is able to adapt to new visual reasoning tasks by observing a few training examples and reusing modules.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,ExeDec: Execution Decomposition for Compositional Generalization in Neural Program Synthesis,"When writing programs, people have the ability to tackle a new complex task by decomposing it into smaller and more familiar subtasks. While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step. When used with Transformer models trained from scratch, ExeDec has better synthesis performance and greatly improved compositional generalization ability compared to baselines. Finally, we use our benchmarks to demonstrate that LLMs struggle to compositionally generalize when asked to do programming-by-example in a few-shot setting, but an ExeDec-style prompting approach can improve the generalization ability and overall performance.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,RA-DIT: Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning,"Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) improve performance by accessing long-tail and up-to-date knowledge from external data stores, but are challenging to build. Existing approaches require either expensive retrieval-specific modifications to LM pre-training or use post-hoc integration of the data store that leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning (RA-DIT), a lightweight fine-tuning methodology that provides a third option by retrofitting any LLM with retrieval capabilities. Our approach operates in two distinct fine-tuning steps: (1) one updates a pre-trained LM to better use retrieved information, while (2) the other updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM. By fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, we demonstrate that each stage yields significant performance improvements, and using both leads to additional gains. Our best model, RA-DIT 65B, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing in-context RALM approaches by up to +8.9% in 0-shot setting and +1.4% in 5-shot setting on average.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,A Probabilistic Framework for Modular Continual Learning,"Modular approaches that use a different composition of modules for each problem are a promising direction in continual learning (CL). However, searching through the large, discrete space of module compositions is challenging, especially because evaluating a composition’s performance requires a round of neural network training. We address this challenge through a modular CL framework, PICLE, that uses a probabilistic model to cheaply compute the fitness of each composition, allowing PICLE to achieve both perceptual, few-shot and latent transfer. The model combines prior knowledge about good module compositions with dataset-specific information. We evaluate PICLE using two benchmark suites designed to assess different desiderata of CL techniques. Comparing to a wide range of approaches, we show that PICLE is the first modular CL algorithm to achieve perceptual, few-shot and latent transfer while scaling well to large search spaces, outperforming previous state-of-the-art modular CL approaches on long problem sequences.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Few-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text using Style Representations,"The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human writing poses a significant risk of abuse. For example, such models could be used for plagiarism, disinformation, spam, or phishing. However, such abuse may be counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by a language model rather than a human. Some previous approaches to this problem have relied on supervised methods trained on corpora of confirmed human and machine-written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification poses an unavoidable challenge for such detectors, making them brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of further language models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the detectors. Other previous approaches require access to the models that generated the text to be detected at inference or detection time, which is often impractical. In light of these challenge, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including state of the art large language models like Llama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given handfuls of examples composed by each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which model specifically generated a given document.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Bayes Conditional Distribution Estimation for Knowledge Distillation Based on Conditional Mutual Information,"It is believed that in knowledge distillation (KD), the role of the teacher is to provide an estimate for the unknown Bayes conditional probability distribution (BCPD) to be used in the student training process. Conventionally, this estimate is obtained by training the teacher using maximum log-likelihood (MLL) method. To improve this estimate for KD, in this paper we introduce the concept of conditional mutual information (CMI) into the estimation of BCPD and propose a novel estimator called the maximum CMI (MCMI) method. Specifically, in MCMI estimation, both the log-likelihood and CMI of the teacher are simultaneously maximized when the teacher is trained. In fact, maximizing the teacher's CMI value ensures that the teacher can effectively capture the contextual information within the images, and for visualizing this information, we deploy Eigen-CAM. Via conducting a thorough set of experiments, we show that by employing a teacher trained via MCMI estimation rather than one trained via MLL estimation in various state-of-the-art KD frameworks, the student's classification accuracy consistently increases, with the gain of up to 3.32\%. This suggests that the teacher's BCPD estimate provided by MCMI method is more accurate than that provided by MLL method. In addition, we show that such improvements in the student's accuracy are more drastic in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably, the student's accuracy increases with the gain of up to 5.72\% when 5\% of the training samples are available to student (few-shot), and increases from 0\% to as high as 84\% for an omitted class (zero-shot).",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Quantifying Language Models' Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design or: How I learned to start worrying about prompt formatting,"As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FormatSpread, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,"Rephrase, Augment, Reason: Visual Grounding of Questions for Vision-Language Models","An increasing number of vision-language tasks can be handled with little to no training, i.e., in a zero and few-shot manner, by marrying large language models (LLMs) to vision encoders, resulting in large vision-language models (LVLMs). While this has huge upsides, such as not requiring training data or custom architectures, how an input is presented to an LVLM can have a major impact on zero-shot model performance. In particular, inputs phrased in an underspecified way can result in incorrect answers due to factors like missing visual information, complex implicit reasoning, or linguistic ambiguity. Therefore, adding visually-grounded information to the input as a preemptive clarification should improve model performance by reducing underspecification, e.g., by localizing objects and disambiguating references. Similarly, in the VQA setting, changing the way questions are framed can make them easier for models to answer. To this end, we present **Rep**hrase, **A**ugment and **Re**ason (RepARe), a gradient-free framework that extracts salient details about the image using the underlying LVLM as a captioner and reasoner, in order to propose modifications to the original question. We then use the LVLM’s confidence over a generated answer as an unsupervised scoring function to select the rephrased question most likely to improve zero-shot performance. Focusing on three visual question answering tasks, we show that RepARe can result in a 3.85% (absolute) increase in zero-shot accuracy on VQAv2, 6.41%, and 7.94% points increase on A-OKVQA, and VizWiz respectively. Additionally, we find that using gold answers for oracle question candidate selection achieves a substantial gain in VQA accuracy by up to 14.41%. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that outputs from RepARe increase syntactic complexity, and effectively utilize vision-language interaction and the frozen LLM.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Zoology: Measuring and Improving  Recall in Efficient Language Models,"Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are growing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive performance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of 17 attention and gated-convolution language models, finding that SoTA gated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1 perplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap is explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously mentioned in-context, e.g. ""Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it means no"" -> ??. On this task, termed ""associative recall"", we find that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M parameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution model on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated convolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability.  To close the gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of the task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects actual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that elucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and gated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple convolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse attention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling.

ICLR,2024,Adapting to Distribution Shift by Visual Domain Prompt Generation,"In this paper, we aim to adapt a model at test-time using a few unlabeled data to address distribution shifts. 
To tackle the challenges of extracting domain knowledge from a limited amount of data, it is crucial to utilize correlated information from pre-trained backbones and source domains. Previous studies fail to utilize recent foundation models with strong out-of-distribution generalization. Additionally, domain-centric designs are not flavored in their works. Furthermore, they employ the process of modelling source domains and the process of learning to adapt independently into disjoint training stages. In this work, we propose an approach on top of the pre-computed features of the foundation model. Specifically, we build a knowledge bank to learn the transferable knowledge from source domains. Conditioned on few-shot target data, we introduce a domain prompt generator to condense the knowledge bank into a domain-specific prompt. The domain prompt then directs the visual features towards a particular domain via a guidance module. Moreover, we propose a domain-aware contrastive loss and employ meta-learning to facilitate domain knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the domain knowledge extraction. The proposed method outperforms previous work on 5 large-scale benchmarks including WILDS and DomainNet.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,T-MARS: Improving Visual Representations by Circumventing Text Feature Learning,"Large web-crawled multimodal datasets have powered a slew of new methods for learning general-purpose visual representations, advancing the state of the art in computer vision and revolutionizing zero- and few-shot recognition. One crucial decision facing practitioners is how, if at all, to curate these ever-larger datasets. For example, the creators of the LAION-5B dataset chose to retain only image-caption pairs whose CLIP similarity score exceeded a designated threshold. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art data filtering approach motivated by our observation that nearly $40\%$ of LAION's images contain text that overlaps significantly with the caption. Intuitively, such data could be wasteful as it incentivizes models to perform optical character recognition rather than learning visual features. However, naively removing all such data could also be wasteful, as it throws away images that contain visual features (in addition to overlapping text). Our simple and scalable approach, T-MARS (Text Masking and Re-Scoring), filters out only those pairs where the text dominates the remaining visual features---by first masking out the text and then filtering out those with a low CLIP similarity score of the masked image with original captions. Experimentally, T-MARS is the top ranked approach on Imagenet at ``medium scale'' of DataComp (a data filtering benchmark), and outperforms CLIP filtering by a margin of $6.5\%$ on ImageNet and $4.7\%$ on VTAB. Additionally, we show that the accuracy gains enjoyed by T-MARS linearly increase as data and compute are scaled exponentially.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2024,FeatUp: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Features at Any Resolution,"Deep features are a cornerstone of computer vision research, capturing image semantics and enabling the community to solve downstream tasks even in the zero- or few-shot regime. However, these features often lack the spatial resolution to directly perform dense prediction tasks like segmentation and depth prediction because models aggressively pool information over large areas. In this work, we introduce FeatUp, a task- and model-agnostic framework to restore lost spatial information in deep features. We introduce two variants of FeatUp: one that guides features with high-resolution signal in a single forward pass, and one that fits an implicit model to a single image to reconstruct features at any resolution. Both approaches use a multi-view consistency loss with deep analogies to NeRFs. Our features retain their original semantics and can be swapped into existing applications to yield resolution and performance gains even without re-training. We show that FeatUp significantly outperforms other feature upsampling and image super-resolution approaches in class activation map generation, transfer learning for segmentation and depth prediction, and end-to-end training for semantic segmentation.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into State-of-the-Art Pipelines,"The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks. Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded “prompt templates”, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, or imperative computational graphs where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric, by creating and collecting demonstrations. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, DSPy can automatically produce pipelines that outperform out-of-the-box few-shot prompting as well as expert-created demonstrations for GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13b-chat. On top of that, DSPy programs compiled for relatively small LMs like 770M parameter T5 and Llama2-13b-chat are competitive with many approaches that rely on large and proprietary LMs like GPT-3.5 and on expert-written prompt chains.

ICLR,2024,Leveraging Generative Models for Unsupervised Alignment of Neural Time Series Data,"Large scale inference models are widely used in neuroscience to extract latent representations from high-dimensional neural recordings. Due to the statistical heterogeneities between sessions and animals, a new model is trained from scratch to infer the underlying dynamics for each new dataset. This is computationally expensive and does not fully leverage all the available data. Moreover, as these models get more complex, they can be challenging to train. In parallel, it is becoming common to use pre-trained models in the machine learning community for few shot and transfer learning. One major hurdle that prevents the re-use of generative models in neuroscience is the complex spatio-temporal structure of neural dynamics within and across animals. Interestingly, the underlying dynamics identified from different datasets on the same task are qualitatively similar. In this work, we exploit this observation and propose a source-free and unsupervised alignment approach that utilizes the learnt dynamics and enables the re-use of trained generative models. We validate our approach on simulations and show the efficacy of the alignment on neural recordings from the motor cortex obtained during a reaching task.",📊 评测基准与数据集

Inspired by the success of large pretrained models in vision and language domains, we reframe the analysis of large-scale, cellular-resolution neuronal spiking data into an auto-regressive spatiotemporal generation problem. Neuroformer is a multimodal, multitask generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model that is specifically designed to handle the intricacies of data in systems neuroscience. It scales linearly with feature size, can process an arbitrary number of modalities, and is adaptable to downstream tasks, such as predicting behavior. We first trained Neuroformer on simulated datasets, and found that it both accurately predicted simulated neuronal circuit activity, and also intrinsically inferred the underlying neural circuit connectivity, including direction. When pretrained to decode neural responses, the model predicted the behavior of a mouse with only few-shot fine-tuning, suggesting that the model begins learning how to do so directly from the neural representations themselves, without any explicit supervision. We used an ablation study to show that joint training on neuronal responses and behavior boosted performance, highlighting the model's ability to associate behavioral and neural representations in an unsupervised manner. These findings show that Neuroformer can analyze neural datasets and their emergent properties, informing the development of models and hypotheses associated with the brain.",📊 评测基准与数据集

Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces $\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial components: (1)  Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and retain their original abilities on languages.

In this paper, we propose SALMONN, a speech audio language music open neural network, built by integrating a pre-trained text-based large language model (LLM) with speech and audio encoders into a single multimodal model. SALMONN enables the LLM to directly process and understand general audio inputs and achieve competitive performances on a number of speech and audio tasks used in training, such as

ICLR,2024,Batch Calibration: Rethinking Calibration for In-Context Learning and Prompt Engineering,"Prompting and in-context learning (ICL) have become efficient learning paradigms for large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs suffer from prompt brittleness and various bias factors in the prompt, including but not limited to the formatting, the choice verbalizers, and the ICL examples. To address this problem that results in unexpected performance degradation, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of these biases while recovering LLM performance. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of the existing calibration methods, where we both provide a unified view and reveal the failure cases. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Batch Calibration (BC), a simple yet intuitive method that controls the contextual bias from the batched input, unifies various prior approaches and effectively addresses the aforementioned issues. BC is zero-shot, inference-only, and incurs negligible additional costs. In the few-shot setup, we further extend BC to allow it to learn the contextual bias from labeled data. We validate the effectiveness of BC with PaLM 2-(S, M, L) and CLIP models and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous calibration baselines across more than 10 natural language understanding and image classification tasks.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,First-order ANIL provably learns representations despite overparametrisation,"Due to its empirical success in few-shot classification and reinforcement learning, meta-learning has recently received significant interest. Meta-learning methods leverage data from previous tasks to learn a new task in a sample-efficient manner. In particular, model-agnostic methods look for initialization points from which gradient descent quickly adapts to any new task. Although it has been empirically suggested that such methods perform well by learning shared representations during pretraining, there is limited theoretical evidence of such behavior. More importantly, it has not been shown that these methods still learn a shared structure, despite architectural misspecifications. In this direction, this work shows, in the limit of an infinite number of tasks, that first-order ANIL with a linear two-layer network architecture successfully learns linear shared representations. This result even holds with _overparametrization_; having a width larger than the dimension of the shared representations results in an asymptotically low-rank solution. The learned solution then yields a good adaptation performance on any new task after a single gradient step. Overall, this illustrates how well model-agnostic methods such as first-order ANIL can learn shared representations.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Scalable Modular Network: A Framework for Adaptive Learning via Agreement Routing,"In this paper, we propose a novel modular network framework, called Scalable Modular Network (SMN), which enables adaptive learning capability and supports integration of new modules after pre-training for better adaptation.
This adaptive capability comes from a novel design of router within SMN, named agreement router, which selects and composes different specialist modules through an iterative message passing process.
The agreement router iteratively computes the agreements among a set of input and outputs of all modules to allocate inputs to specific module.
During the iterative routing, messages of modules are passed to each other, which improves the module selection process with consideration of both local interactions (between a single module and input) and global interactions involving multiple other modules.
To validate our contributions, we conduct experiments on two problems: a toy min-max game and few-shot image classification task. 
Our experimental results demonstrate that SMN can generalize to new distributions and exhibit sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks. 
Furthermore, SMN can achieve a better adaptation capability when new modules are introduced after pre-training.

ICLR,2024,Bongard-OpenWorld: Few-Shot Reasoning for Free-form Visual Concepts in the Real World,"We introduce Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating real-world few-shot reasoning for machine vision. It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2)  real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%.

Current large TTS systems usually quantize speech into discrete tokens and use language models to generate these tokens one by one, which suffer from unstable prosody, word skipping/repeating issue, and poor voice quality. In this paper, we develop NaturalSpeech 2, a TTS system that leverages a neural audio codec with residual vector quantizers to get the quantized latent vectors and uses a diffusion model to generate these latent vectors conditioned on text input. To enhance the zero-shot capability that is important to achieve diverse speech synthesis, we design a speech prompting mechanism to facilitate in-context learning in the diffusion model and the duration/pitch predictor. We scale NaturalSpeech 2 to large-scale datasets with 44K hours of speech and singing data and evaluate its voice quality on unseen speakers. NaturalSpeech 2 outperforms previous TTS systems by a large margin in terms of prosody/timbre similarity, robustness, and voice quality in a zero-shot setting, and performs novel zero-shot singing synthesis with only a speech prompt.

ICLR,2024,MMICL: Empowering Vision-language Model with Multi-Modal In-Context Learning,"Since the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) enhanced by large language models (LLMs) have grown exponentially in popularity. 
However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs less effective in downstream vision-language tasks.
In this paper, we address the limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with **M**ulti-**M**odal **I**n-**C**ontext **L**earning(MMICL), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to understand complex multi-modal prompts.
Our experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL ability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates language bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when faced with extensive textual context.

ICLR,2024,How Do Transformers Learn In-Context Beyond Simple Functions? A Case Study on Learning with Representations,"While large language models based on the transformer architecture have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, understandings of such capabilities are still in an early stage, where existing theory and mechanistic understanding focus mostly on simple scenarios such as learning simple function classes. This paper takes initial steps on understanding ICL in more complex scenarios, by studying learning with \emph{representations}. Concretely, we construct synthetic in-context learning problems with a compositional structure, where the label depends on the input through a possibly complex but \emph{fixed} representation function, composed with a linear function that \emph{differs} in each instance. By construction, the optimal ICL algorithm first transforms the inputs by the representation function, and then performs linear ICL on top of the transformed dataset. We show theoretically the existence of transformers that approximately implement such algorithms with mild depth and size.  Empirically, we find trained transformers consistently achieve near-optimal ICL performance in this setting, and exhibit the desired dissection where lower layers transforms the dataset and upper layers perform linear ICL. Through extensive probing and a new pasting experiment, we further reveal several mechanisms within the trained transformers, such as concrete copying behaviors on both the inputs and the representations, linear ICL capability of the upper layers alone, and a post-ICL representation selection mechanism in a harder mixture setting. These observed mechanisms align well with our theory and may shed light on how transformers perform ICL in more realistic scenarios.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Pretraining,"Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms. 

This paper provides a theoretical framework that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently proposed training methods --- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from offline trajectories.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2024,DQ-LoRe: Dual Queries with Low Rank Approximation Re-ranking for In-Context Learning,"Recent advances in natural language processing, primarily propelled by Large Language Models (LLMs), have showcased their remarkable capabilities grounded in in-context learning. A promising avenue for guiding LLMs in intricate reasoning tasks involves the utilization of intermediate reasoning steps within the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. Nevertheless, the central challenge lies in the effective selection of exemplars for facilitating in-context learning. In this study, we introduce a framework that leverages Dual Queries and Low-rank approximation Re-ranking (DQ-LoRe) to automatically select exemplars for in-context learning. Dual Queries first query LLM to obtain LLM-generated knowledge such as CoT, then query the retriever to obtain the final exemplars via both question and the knowledge. Moreover, for the second query, LoRe employs dimensionality reduction techniques to refine exemplar selection, ensuring close alignment with the input question's knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DQ-LoRe significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in the automatic selection of exemplars for GPT-4, enhancing performance from 92.5\% to 94.2\%. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that DQ-LoRe consistently outperforms retrieval-based approaches in terms of both performance and adaptability, especially in scenarios characterized by distribution shifts. DQ-LoRe pushes the boundaries of in-context learning and opens up new avenues for addressing complex reasoning challenges.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,Meta-Learning Priors Using Unrolled Proximal Networks,"Relying on prior knowledge accumulated from related tasks, meta-learning offers a powerful approach to learning a novel task from a limited number of training data. Recent approaches use a family of prior probability density functions or recurrent neural network models, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing labeled data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling.  The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within *tight* theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for language models demonstrates impressive performance across reasoning tasks, but typically needs labeled exemplars of the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, analogical prompting, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language models. Inspired by analogical reasoning, a cognitive process in which humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems, our approach prompts language models to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for labeling or retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can also tailor the generated exemplars and knowledge to each problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,Time-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models,"Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that \method is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. The code is made available at https://github.com/KimMeen/Time-LLM.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,BayesPrompt: Prompting Large-Scale Pre-Trained Language Models on Few-shot Inference via Debiased Domain Abstraction,"As a novel and effective fine-tuning paradigm based on large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), prompt-tuning aims to reduce the gap between downstream tasks and pre-training objectives. While prompt-tuning has yielded continuous advancements in various tasks, such an approach still remains a persistent defect: prompt-tuning methods fail to generalize to specific few-shot patterns. From the perspective of distribution analyses, we disclose that the intrinsic issues behind the phenomenon are the over-multitudinous conceptual knowledge contained in PLMs and the abridged knowledge for target downstream domains, which jointly result in that PLMs mis-locate the knowledge distributions corresponding to the target domains in the universal knowledge embedding space. To this end, we intuitively explore to approximate the unabridged target domains of downstream tasks in a debiased manner, and then abstract such domains to generate discriminative prompts, thereby providing the de-ambiguous guidance for PLMs. Guided by such an intuition, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely BayesPrompt, to learn prompts that contain the domain discriminative information against the interference from domain-irrelevant knowledge. BayesPrompt primitively leverages known distributions to approximate the debiased factual distributions of target domains and further uniformly samples certain representative features from the approximated distributions to generate the ultimate prompts for PLMs. We provide theoretical insights with the connection to domain adaptation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Zero and Few-shot Semantic Parsing with Ambiguous Inputs,"Despite the frequent challenges posed by ambiguity when representing meaning via natural language, it is often ignored or deliberately removed in tasks mapping language to formally-designed representations, which generally assume a one-to-one mapping between linguistic and formal representations. 
We attempt to address this shortcoming by introducing AmP, a framework, dataset, and challenge for translating ambiguous natural language to formal representations like logic and code. 
We define templates and generate data for five well-documented linguistic ambiguities.
Using AmP, we investigate how several few-shot text-to-code systems handle ambiguity, introducing three new metrics.
We find that large pre-trained models perform poorly at capturing the distribution of possible meanings without deliberate instruction.
However, models are able to capture the distribution well when ambiguity is attested in their inputs. 
These results motivate a call for including ambiguity explicitly in datasets and promote considering the distribution of possible outputs when evaluating systems. We release our data and code.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,Privacy-Preserving In-Context Learning for Large Language Models,"In-context learning (ICL) is an important capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling these models to dynamically adapt based on specific, in-context exemplars, thereby improving accuracy and relevance.
However, LLM's responses may leak the sensitive private information contained in in-context exemplars. 
To address this challenge, we propose Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), a general paradigm for privatizing ICL tasks. 
The key idea for DP-ICL paradigm is generating differentially private responses through a noisy consensus among an ensemble of LLM's responses based on disjoint exemplar sets. 
Based on the general paradigm of DP-ICL, we instantiate several techniques showing how to privatize ICL for text classification and language generation. 
We experiment on four text classification benchmarks and two language generation tasks, and our empirical findings suggest that our DP-ICL achieves a strong utility-privacy tradeoff.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2024,SALMON: Self-Alignment with Instructable Reward Models,"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on response demonstrations combined with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) constitutes a powerful paradigm for aligning LLM-based AI agents. However, a significant limitation of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON, to align base language models with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is an instructable reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles. By merely adjusting these principles during the RL training phase, we gain full control over the preferences with the instructable reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL-trained policy models, and reducing the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on various benchmark datasets. We have open-sourced the code and model weights to encourage further research into aligning LLM-based AI agents with enhanced supervision efficiency, improved controllability, and scalable oversight.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2024,Teaching Language Models to Hallucinate Less with Synthetic Tasks,"Large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate on abstractive summarization tasks such as document-based question-answering, meeting summarization, and clinical report generation, even though all necessary information is included in context. However, optimizing to make LLMs hallucinate less is challenging, as hallucination is hard to efficiently, cheaply, and reliably evaluate at each optimization step. In this work, we show that reducing hallucination on a _synthetic task_ can also reduce hallucination on real-world downstream tasks. Our method, SynTra, first designs a synthetic task where hallucinations are easy to elicit and measure. It next optimizes the LLM's system message via prefix tuning on the synthetic task, then uses the system message on realistic, hard-to-optimize tasks. Across three realistic abstractive summarization tasks, we reduce hallucination for two 13B-parameter LLMs using supervision signal from only a synthetic retrieval task. We also find that optimizing the system message rather than the model weights can be critical; fine-tuning the entire model on the synthetic task can counterintuitively _increase_ hallucination. Overall, SynTra demonstrates that the extra flexibility of working with synthetic data can help mitigate undesired behaviors in practice.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Can LLMs Keep a Secret? Testing  Privacy  Implications of Language Models  via Contextual Integrity Theory,"Existing efforts on quantifying privacy implications for large language models (LLMs) solely focus on measuring leakage of training data. In this work, we shed light on the often-overlooked interactive settings where an LLM receives information from multiple sources and generates an output to be shared with other entities, creating the potential of exposing sensitive input data in inappropriate contexts. In these scenarios, humans nat- urally uphold privacy by choosing whether or not to disclose information depending on the context. We ask the question “Can LLMs demonstrate an equivalent discernment and reasoning capability when considering privacy in context?” We propose CONFAIDE, a benchmark grounded in the theory of contextual integrity and designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. CONFAIDE consists of four tiers, gradually increasing in complexity, with the final tier evaluating contextual privacy reasoning and theory of mind capabilities. Our experiments show that even commercial models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively, highlighting the urgent need for a new direction of privacy-preserving approaches as we demonstrate a larger underlying problem stemmed in the models’ lack of reasoning capabilities.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2024,AUC-CL: A Batchsize-Robust Framework for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning,"Self-supervised learning through contrastive representations is an emergent and promising avenue, aiming at alleviating the availability of labeled data. Recent research in the field also demonstrates its viability for several downstream tasks, henceforth leading to works that implement the contrastive principle through innovative loss functions and methods. However, despite achieving impressive progress, most methods depend on prohibitively large batch sizes and compute requirements for good performance. 
In this work, we propose the $\textbf{AUC}$-$\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\textbf{L}$earning, a new approach to contrastive learning that demonstrates robust and competitive performance in compute-limited regimes. 
We propose to incorporate the contrastive objective within the AUC-maximization framework, by noting that the AUC metric is maximized upon enhancing the probability of the network's binary prediction difference between positive and negative samples which inspires adequate embedding space arrangements in representation learning. Unlike standard contrastive methods, when performing stochastic optimization, our method maintains unbiased stochastic gradients and thus is more robust to batchsizes as opposed to standard stochastic optimization problems.
Remarkably, our method with a batch size of 256, outperforms several state-of-the-art methods that may need much larger batch sizes (e.g., 4096), on ImageNet and other standard datasets. Experiments on transfer learning, few-shot learning, and other downstream tasks also demonstrate the viability of our method.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,Teaching Arithmetic to Small Transformers,"Large language models like GPT-4 exhibit emergent capabilities across general-purpose tasks, such as basic arithmetic, when trained on extensive text data, even though these tasks are not explicitly encoded by the unsupervised, next-token prediction objective. This study investigates how even small transformers, trained from random initialization, can efficiently learn arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and elementary functions like square root, using the next-token prediction objective. We first demonstrate that conventional training data is not the most effective for arithmetic learning, and simple formatting changes can significantly improve accuracy. This leads to sharp phase transitions as a function of training data scale, which, in some cases, can be explained through connections to low-rank matrix completion. Building on prior work, we then train on chain-of-thought style data that includes intermediate step results. Even in the complete absence of pretraining, this approach significantly and simultaneously improves accuracy, sample complexity, and convergence speed. We also study the interplay between arithmetic and text data during training and examine the effects of few-shot prompting, pretraining, and parameter scaling. Additionally, we discuss the challenges associated with length generalization. Our work highlights the importance of high-quality, instructive data that considers the particular characteristics of the next-word prediction loss for rapidly eliciting arithmetic capabilities.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,SAFLEX: Self-Adaptive Augmentation via Feature Label Extrapolation,"Data augmentation, a cornerstone technique in deep learning, is crucial in enhancing model performance, especially with scarce labeled data. While traditional techniques are effective, their reliance on hand-crafted methods limits their applicability across diverse data types and tasks. Although modern learnable augmentation methods offer increased adaptability, they are computationally expensive and challenging to incorporate within prevalent augmentation workflows. In this work, we present a novel, efficient method for data augmentation, effectively bridging the gap between existing augmentation strategies and emerging datasets and learning tasks. We introduce SAFLEX (Self-Adaptive Augmentation via Feature Label EXtrapolation), which learns the sample weights and soft labels of augmented samples provided by any given upstream augmentation pipeline, using a specifically designed efficient bilevel optimization algorithm. Remarkably, SAFLEX effectively reduces the noise and label errors of the upstream augmentation pipeline with a marginal computational cost. As a versatile module, SAFLEX excels across diverse datasets, including natural and medical images and tabular data, showcasing its prowess in few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization. SAFLEX seamlessly integrates with common augmentation strategies like RandAug, CutMix, and those from large pre-trained generative models like stable diffusion and is also compatible with frameworks such as CLIP's fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the potential to adapt existing augmentation pipelines for new data types and tasks, signaling a move towards more adaptable and resilient training frameworks.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,DP-OPT: Make Large Language Model Your Privacy-Preserving Prompt Engineer,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as dominant tools for various tasks, particularly when tailored for a specific target by prompt tuning. Nevertheless, concerns surrounding data privacy present obstacles due to the tuned prompts' dependency on sensitive private information. A practical solution is to host a local LLM and optimize a soft prompt privately using data. Yet, hosting a local model becomes problematic when model ownership is protected. Alternative methods, like sending data to the model's provider for training, intensify these privacy issues facing an untrusted provider. In this paper, we present a novel solution called Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning (DP-OPT) to address this challenge. Our approach involves tuning a discrete prompt on the client side and then applying it to the desired cloud models. We demonstrate that prompts suggested by LLMs themselves can be transferred without compromising performance significantly. To ensure that the prompts do not leak private information, we introduce the first private prompt generation mechanism, by a differentially-private (DP) ensemble of in-context learning with private demonstrations.  With DP-OPT, generating privacy-preserving prompts by Vicuna-7b can yield competitive performance compared to non-private in-context learning on GPT3.5 or local private prompt tuning.

ICLR,2024,Compressing LLMs: The Truth is Rarely Pure and Never Simple,"Despite their remarkable achievements, modern Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter exorbitant computational and memory footprints. Recently, several works have shown significant success in *training-free* and  *data-free* compression (pruning and quantization) of LLMs achieving 50-60\% sparsity and reducing the bit-width down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible perplexity degradation over the uncompressed baseline. As recent research efforts are focused on developing increasingly sophisticated compression methods, our work takes a step back, and re-evaluates the effectiveness of existing SoTA compression methods, which rely on a fairly simple and widely questioned metric, perplexity (even for dense LLMs). We introduce **K**nowledge-**I**ntensive **C**ompressed LLM Benchmar**K** **(LLM-KICK)**, a collection of carefully-curated tasks to re-define the evaluation protocol for compressed LLMs, which have significant alignment with their dense counterparts, and perplexity fail to capture subtle change in their true capabilities. LLM-KICK unveils many favorable merits and unfortunate plights of current SoTA compression methods: all pruning methods suffer significant performance degradation, sometimes at trivial sparsity ratios (*e.g.*, 25-30\%), and fail for N:M sparsity on knowledge-intensive tasks; current quantization methods are more successful than pruning; yet, pruned LLMs even at $\geq 50$\% sparsity are robust in-context retrieval and summarization systems; among others. LLM-KICK is designed to holistically access compressed LLMs' ability for language understanding, reasoning, generation, in-context retrieval, in-context summarization, *etc.* We hope our study can foster the development of better LLM compression methods.

ICLR,2024,The Cost of Scaling Down Large Language Models: Reducing Model Size Affects Memory before In-context Learning,"We study how down-scaling large language model (LLM) size impacts LLM capabilities. We begin by measuring the effects of weight pruning – a popular technique for reducing model size – on the two abilities of LLMs: (a) recalling facts presented during pre-training and (b) processing information presented in context. Surprisingly, we find that existing pruning techniques affect these two abilities of LLMs differently. For example, pruning more than 30% of weights significantly decreases an LLM’s ability to recall facts presented during pre-training. Yet pruning 60-70% of weights largely preserves an LLM’s ability to process information in-context, ranging from retrieving answers based on information presented in context to learning parameterized functions such as a linear classifier based on a few examples. Moderate pruning impairs LLM’s ability to recall facts learnt from pre-training. However, its effect on model’s ability to process information presented in context is much less pronounced. The said disparate effects similarly arise when replacing the original model with a smaller dense one with reduced width and depth. This similarity suggests that model size reduction in general underpins the said disparity.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

ICLR,2024,Emu: Generative Pretraining in Multimodality,"We present Emu, a multimodal foundation model that seamlessly generates images and text in multimodal context. This omnivore model can take in any single-modality or multimodal data input indiscriminately (e.g., interleaved image, text and video) through a one-model-for-all autoregressive training process. First, visual signals are encoded into embeddings, and together with text tokens form an interleaved input sequence. Emu is end-to-end trained with a unified objective of classifying the next text token or regressing the next visual embedding in the multimodal sequence. This versatile multimodality empowers the leverage of diverse pretraining data sources at scale, such as videos with interleaved frames and text, webpages with interleaved images and text, as well as web-scale image-text pairs and video-text pairs. Emu can serve as a generalist multimodal interface for both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, supporting in-context image and text generation. Across a broad range of zero-shot/few-shot tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, video question answering and text-to-image generation, Emu demonstrates superb performance compared to state-of-the-art large multimodal models.

ICLR,2024,Mixture-of-Experts Meets Instruction Tuning: A Winning Combination for Large Language Models,"Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural architecture design that adds learnable parameters to Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing computational complexity (FLOPs). Instruction tuning is a technique for training LLMs to follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we find that MoE models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. In particular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i) Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning; (ii) Instruction tuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplemented by further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario, MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computational capacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introduction of instruction tuning (in the second and third scenarios), used independently or in conjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model, FLAN-MoE-32B, surpasses the performance of Flan-PaLM-62B on four benchmark tasks, while using only a third of the FLOPs.

ICLR,2024,Hypothesis Search: Inductive Reasoning with Language Models,"Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which can then be robustly generalized to novel scenarios. Recent work has evaluated large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding ""in context learning."" This can work well for straightforward inductive tasks, but performs very poorly on more complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be directly verified by running on the observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. To reduce the hypothesis search space, we explore steps to filter the set of hypotheses to be implemented as programs: we either ask the LLM to summarize them into a smaller set of hypotheses, or ask human annotators to select a subset. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, and string transformation dataset SyGuS. On a random 40-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 27.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 12.5%). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, the performance is boosted to 37.5%.

ICLR,2024,Follow-Up Differential Descriptions: Language Models Resolve Ambiguities for Image Classification,"A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e., prompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow. However, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of commonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful information that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance, they may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and wrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions (FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each dataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target classes. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that differentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial ambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD consistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated descriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an effective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly degrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class descriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot adaptation methods.",📊 评测基准与数据集

We propose SLiMe, which frames this problem as an optimization task. Specifically, given a single image and its segmentation mask, we first extract our novel “weighted accumulated self-attention map” along with cross-attention map from the SD prior. Then, using these extracted maps, the text embeddings of SD are optimized to highlight the segmented region in these attention maps, which in turn can be used to derive new segmentation results. Moreover, leveraging additional training data when available, i.e. few-shot, improves the performance of SLiMe.

Simultaneously, pretrained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities at solving a wide range of programming tasks. To that end, we introduce a framework for adapting LLMs to high-level program optimization. First, we curate a dataset of performance-improving edits made by human programmers of over 77,000 competitive C++ programming submission pairs, accompanied by extensive unit tests. A major challenge is the significant variability of measuring performance on commodity hardware, which can lead to spurious ""improvements."" To isolate and reliably evaluate the impact of program optimizations, we design an environment based on the gem5 full system simulator, the de facto simulator used in academia and industry. Next, we propose a broad range of adaptation strategies for code optimization; for prompting, these include retrieval-based few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought, and for finetuning, these include performance-conditioned generation and synthetic data augmentation based on self-play. A combination of these techniques achieves a mean speedup of 6.86$\times$ with eight generations, higher than average optimizations from individual programmers (3.66$\times$). Using our model's fastest generations, we set a new upper limit on the fastest speedup possible for our dataset at 9.64$\times$ compared to using the fastest human submissions available (9.56$\times$).",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,One For All: Towards Training One Graph Model For All Classification Tasks,"Designing a single model to address multiple tasks has been a long-standing objective in artificial intelligence. Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose **One for All (OFA)**, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,MEND: Meta Demonstration Distillation for Efficient and Effective In-Context Learning,"Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, 
where a LLM makes predictions for a given test input together with a few input-output pairs (demonstrations).
Nevertheless, the inclusion of demonstrations poses a challenge, leading to a quadratic increase in the computational overhead of the self-attention mechanism.
Existing solutions attempt to condense lengthy demonstrations into compact vectors. 
However, they often require task-specific retraining or compromise LLM's in-context learning performance. 
To mitigate these challenges, we present Meta Demonstration Distillation (MEND), where a language model learns to distill any lengthy demonstrations into vectors without retraining for a new downstream task. 
We exploit the knowledge distillation to enhance alignment between MEND and MEND, achieving both efficiency and effectiveness concurrently. 
MEND is endowed with the meta-knowledge of distilling demonstrations through a two-stage training process, which includes meta-distillation pretraining and fine-tuning.
Comprehensive evaluations across seven diverse ICL settings using decoder-only (GPT-2) and encoder-decoder (T5) attest to MEND's prowess.
It not only matches but often outperforms the Vanilla ICL as well as other state-of-the-art distillation models, while significantly reducing the computational demands. 
This innovation promises enhanced scalability and efficiency for the practical deployment of large language models.",⚡ 效率优化
ICLR,2024,In-Context Learning Learns Label Relationships but Is Not Conventional Learning,"The predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks often improve significantly when including examples of the input–label relationship in the context. However, there is currently no consensus about how this in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs works. For example, while Xie et al. (2022) liken ICL to a general-purpose learning algorithm, Min et al. (2022b) argue ICL does not even learn label relationships from in-context examples. In this paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information, revealing both capabilities and limitations. To ensure we obtain a comprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICL predictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples are provided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend on in-context labels and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context. However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome prediction preferences acquired from pre-training data and, further, that ICL does not consider all in-context information equally.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,Neural Fine-Tuning Search for Few-Shot Learning,"In few-shot recognition, a classifier that has been trained on one set of classes is required to rapidly adapt and generalize to a disjoint, novel set of classes. To that end, recent studies have shown the efficacy of fine-tuning with carefully-crafted adaptation architectures. However this raises the question of: How can one design the optimal adaptation strategy? In this paper, we study this question through the lens of neural architecture search (NAS). Given a pre-trained neural network, our algorithm discovers the optimal arrangement of adapters, which layers to keep frozen, and which to fine-tune. We demonstrate the generality of our NAS method by applying it to both residual networks and vision transformers and report state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset and Meta-Album.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,The Unlocking Spell on Base LLMs:  Rethinking Alignment via In-Context Learning,"Alignment tuning has become the de facto standard practice for enabling base large language models (LLMs) to serve as open-domain AI assistants. The alignment tuning process typically involves instruction learning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). A recent study, LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), shows that using merely 1K examples for SFT can achieve significant alignment performance as well, suggesting that the effect of alignment tuning might be ""superficial."" This raises questions about how exactly the alignment tuning transforms a base LLM. 

We analyze the effect of alignment tuning by examining the token distribution shift between base LLMs and their aligned counterparts (e.g., Llama-2 and Llama-2-chat). Our findings reveal that base LLMs and their alignment-tuned versions perform nearly identically in decoding on the majority of token positions (i.e., they share the top-ranked tokens). Most distribution shifts occur with stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers, safety disclaimers). This direct evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that alignment tuning primarily learns to adopt the language style of AI assistants, and that the knowledge required for answering user queries predominantly comes from the base LLMs themselves. 

Based on these findings, we rethink the alignment of LLMs by posing the research question: how effectively can we align base LLMs without SFT or RLHF? To address this, we introduce a simple, tuning-free alignment method, URIAL (Untuned LLMs with Restyled In-context Alignment). URIAL achieves effective alignment purely through in-context learning (ICL) with base LLMs, requiring as few as three constant stylistic examples and a system prompt. We conduct a fine-grained and interpretable evaluation on a diverse set of examples, named just-eval-instruct. Results demonstrate that base LLMs with URIAL can match or even surpass the performance of LLMs aligned with SFT (Mistral-7b-Instruct) or SFT+RLHF (Llama-2-70b-chat). We show that the gap between tuning-free and tuning-based alignment methods can be significantly reduced through strategic prompting and ICL. Our findings on the superficial nature of alignment tuning and results with URIAL suggest that deeper analysis and theoretical understanding of alignment is crucial to future LLM research.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,A Hard-to-Beat Baseline for Training-free CLIP-based Adaptation,"Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has gained popularity for its remarkable zero-shot capacity.
Recent research has focused on developing efficient fine-tuning methods, such as prompt learning and adapter, to enhance CLIP's performance in downstream tasks.
However, these methods still require additional training time and computational resources, which is undesirable for devices with limited resources.
In this paper, we revisit a classical algorithm, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), and apply it to the downstream classification of CLIP.
Typically, GDA assumes that features of each class follow Gaussian distributions with identical covariance.
By leveraging Bayes' formula, the classifier can be expressed in terms of the class means and covariance, which can be estimated from the data without the need for training.
To integrate knowledge from both visual and textual modalities, we ensemble it with the original zero-shot classifier within CLIP.
Extensive results on 17 datasets validate that our method surpasses or achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on few-shot classification, imbalanced learning, and out-of-distribution generalization.
In addition, we extend our method to base-to-new generalization and unsupervised learning, once again demonstrating its superiority over competing approaches.

ICLR,2024,Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding,"Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Compared with generic reasoning, table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data. Chain-of-Thought and its similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular data in the reasoning chain. We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, where tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for intermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular reasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem. The chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions. Chain-of-Table achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM choices.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,Beyond task performance: evaluating and reducing the flaws of large multimodal models with in-context-learning,"Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as the Flamingo model and its subsequent competitors, have started to emerge as natural steps towards generalist agents. However, interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly captured by the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQA accuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their real capabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to human expectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from the current evaluation paradigm, and (1) evaluate 10 recent open-source LMMs from 3B up to 80B parameter scale,  on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention, compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation on these axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. While the current go-to solution to align these models is based on training, such as instruction tuning or RLHF, we rather (2) explore the training-free in-context learning (ICL) as a solution, and study how it affects these limitations. Based on our ICL study, (3) we push ICL further and propose new multimodal ICL variants such as; Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, and Self-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows; (1) Despite their success, LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scaling alone. (2) The effect of ICL on LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite its effectiveness for improved explainability, answer abstention, ICL only slightly improves instruction following, does not improve compositional abilities, and actually even amplifies hallucinations. (3) The proposed ICL variants are promising as post-hoc approaches to efficiently tackle some of those flaws. The code is available here: https://github.com/mshukor/EvALign-ICL.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Few-Shot Meta Learning,"We propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model for the few-shot meta learning problem. We consider episode-wise random variables to model episode-specific generative processes, where these local random variables are governed by a higher-level global random variable. The global variable captures information shared across episodes, while controlling how much the model needs to be adapted to new episodes in a principled Bayesian manner. Within our  framework, prediction on a novel episode/task can be seen as a Bayesian inference problem. For tractable training, we need to be able to relate each local episode-specific solution to the global higher-level parameters. We propose a Normal-Inverse-Wishart model, for which establishing this local-global relationship becomes feasible due to the approximate closed-form solutions for the local posterior distributions. The resulting algorithm is more attractive than the MAML in that it does not maintain a costly computational graph for the sequence of gradient descent steps in an episode. Our approach is also different from existing Bayesian meta learning methods in that rather than modeling a single random variable for all episodes, it leverages a hierarchical structure that exploits the local-global relationships desirable for principled Bayesian learning with many related tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,In-context Exploration-Exploitation for Reinforcement Learning,"In-context learning is a promising approach for online policy learning of offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which can be achieved at inference time without gradient optimization. However, this method is hindered by significant computational costs resulting from the gathering of large training trajectory sets and the need to train large Transformer models. We address this challenge by introducing an In-context Exploration-Exploitation (ICEE) algorithm, designed to optimize the efficiency of in-context policy learning. Unlike existing models, ICEE performs an exploration-exploitation trade-off at inference time within a Transformer model, without the need for explicit Bayesian inference. Consequently, ICEE can solve Bayesian optimization problems as efficiently as Gaussian process biased methods do, but in significantly less time. Through experiments in grid world environments, we demonstrate that ICEE can learn to solve new RL tasks using only tens of episodes, marking a substantial improvement over the hundreds of episodes needed by the previous in-context learning method.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2024,When Do Prompting and Prefix-Tuning Work? A Theory of Capabilities and Limitations,"Context-based fine-tuning methods, including prompting, in-context learning, soft prompting (also known as prompt tuning), and prefix-tuning, have gained popularity due to their ability to often match the performance of full fine-tuning with a fraction of the parameters. Despite their empirical successes, there is little theoretical understanding of how these techniques influence the internal computation of the model and their expressiveness limitations. We show that despite the continuous embedding space being more expressive than the discrete token space, soft-prompting and prefix-tuning are potentially less expressive than full fine-tuning, even with the same number of learnable parameters. Concretely, context-based fine-tuning cannot change the relative attention pattern over the content and can only bias the outputs of an attention layer in a fixed direction. This suggests that while techniques like prompting, in-context learning, soft prompting, and prefix-tuning can effectively elicit skills present in the pretrained model, they may not be able to learn novel tasks that require new attention patterns.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,Understanding In-Context Learning from Repetitions,"This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in-context learning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Our work provides a novel perspective by examining in-context learning via the lens of surface repetitions. We quantitatively investigate the role of surface features in text generation, and empirically establish the existence of \emph{token co-occurrence reinforcement}, a principle that strengthens the relationship between two tokens based on their contextual co-occurrences. Furthermore, we find similar reinforcements lie behind the pretraining corpus, revealing the existence is due to LLMs' efforts to maximize the likelihood. By investigating the dual impacts of these features, our research illuminates the internal workings of in-context learning and expounds on the reasons for its failures. This paper provides an essential contribution to the understanding of in-context learning and its potential limitations, providing a fresh perspective on this exciting capability.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,Few-shot Hybrid Domain Adaptation of Image Generator,"Can a pre-trained generator be adapted to the hybrid of multiple target domains and generate images with integrated attributes of them? In this work, we introduce a new task -- Few-shot $\textit{Hybrid Domain Adaptation}$ (HDA). Given a source generator and several target domains, HDA aims to acquire an adapted generator that preserves the integrated attributes of all target domains, without overriding the source domain's characteristics. Compared with $\textit{Domain Adaptation}$ (DA), HDA offers greater flexibility and versatility to adapt generators to more composite and expansive domains. Simultaneously, HDA also presents more challenges than DA as we have access only to images from individual target domains and lack authentic images from the hybrid domain. To address this issue, we introduce a discriminator-free framework that directly encodes different domains' images into well-separable subspaces. To achieve HDA, we propose a novel directional subspace loss comprised of a distance loss and a direction loss. Concretely, the distance loss blends the attributes of all target domains by reducing the distances from generated images to all target subspaces. The direction loss preserves the characteristics from the source domain by guiding the adaptation along the perpendicular to subspaces. Experiments show that our method can obtain numerous domain-specific attributes in a single adapted generator, which surpasses the baseline methods in semantic similarity, image fidelity, and cross-domain consistency.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Are Human-generated Demonstrations Necessary for In-context Learning?,"Despite the promising few-shot ability of large language models (LLMs), the standard paradigm of In-context Learning (ICL) suffers the disadvantages of susceptibility to selected demonstrations and the intricacy to generate these demonstrations. In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether human-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question, we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the chain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not require hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning strategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafted demonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMs possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,Making LLaMA SEE and Draw with SEED Tokenizer,"The great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded the potential of multimodality, contributing to the gradual evolution of General Artificial Intelligence (AGI). A true AGI agent should not only possess the capability to perform predefined multi-tasks but also exhibit emergent abilities in an open-world context. However, despite the considerable advancements made by recent multimodal LLMs, they still fall short in effectively unifying comprehension and generation tasks, let alone open-world emergent abilities. We contend that the key to overcoming the present impasse lies in enabling text and images to be represented and processed interchangeably within a unified autoregressive Transformer. To this end, we introduce $\textbf{SEED}$, an elaborate image tokenizer that empowers LLMs with the ability to $\textbf{SEE}$ and $\textbf{D}$raw at the same time. We identify two crucial design principles: (1) Image tokens should be independent of 2D physical patch positions and instead be produced with a $\textit{1D causal dependency}$, exhibiting intrinsic interdependence that aligns with the left-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. (2) Image tokens should capture $\textit{high-level semantics}$ consistent with the degree of semantic abstraction in words, and be optimized for both discriminativeness and reconstruction during the tokenizer training phase. With SEED tokens, LLM is able to perform scalable multimodal autoregression under its original training recipe, i.e., next-word prediction. SEED-LLaMA is therefore produced by large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning on the interleaved textual and visual data, demonstrating impressive performance on a broad range of multimodal comprehension and generation tasks. More importantly, SEED-LLaMA has exhibited compositional emergent abilities such as multi-turn in-context multimodal generation, acting like your AI assistant.

ICLR,2024,TEST: Text Prototype Aligned Embedding to Activate LLM's Ability for Time Series,"This work summarizes two ways to accomplish Time-Series (TS) tasks in today's Large Language Model (LLM) context: LLM-for-TS (model-centric) designs and trains a fundamental large model, or fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM for TS data; TS-for-LLM (data-centric) converts TS into a model-friendly representation to enable the pre-trained LLM to handle TS data. Given the lack of data, limited resources, semantic context requirements, and so on, this work focuses on TS-for-LLM, where we aim to activate LLM's ability for TS data by designing a TS embedding method suitable for LLM. The proposed method is named TEST. It first tokenizes TS, builds an encoder to embed TS via instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, where the TS embedding space is aligned to LLM’s embedding layer space, then creates soft prompts to make LLM more open to that embeddings, and finally implements TS tasks using the frozen LLM. We also demonstrate the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theory and experiments. Experiments are carried out on TS classification, forecasting, and representation tasks using eight frozen LLMs with various structures and sizes. The results show that the pre-trained LLM with TEST strategy can achieve better or comparable performance than today's SOTA TS models, and offers benefits for few-shot and generalization. By treating LLM as the pattern machine, TEST can endow LLM's ability to process TS data without compromising language ability. We hope that this study will serve as a foundation for future work to support TS+LLM progress.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2024,BECLR: Batch Enhanced Contrastive Few-Shot Learning,"Learning quickly from very few labeled samples is a fundamental attribute that separates machines and humans in the era of deep representation learning. Unsupervised few-shot learning (U-FSL) aspires to bridge this gap by discarding the reliance on annotations at training time. Intrigued by the success of contrastive learning approaches in the realm of U-FSL, we structurally approach their shortcomings in both pretraining and downstream inference stages. We propose a novel Dynamic Clustered mEmory (DyCE) module to promote a highly separable latent representation space for enhancing positive sampling at the pretraining phase and infusing implicit class-level insights into unsupervised contrastive learning. We then tackle the, somehow overlooked yet critical, issue of sample bias at the few-shot inference stage. We propose an iterative Optimal Transport-based distribution Alignment (OpTA) strategy and demonstrate that it efficiently addresses the problem, especially in low-shot scenarios where FSL approaches suffer the most from sample bias. We later on discuss that DyCE and OpTA are two intertwined pieces of a novel end-to-end approach (we coin as BECLR), constructively magnifying each other's impact. We then present a suite of extensive quantitative and qualitative experimentation to corroborate that BECLR sets a new state-of-the-art across ALL existing U-FSL benchmarks (to the best of our knowledge), and significantly outperforms the best of the current baselines (codebase available at https://github.com/stypoumic/BECLR).",🎯 特定技术方法

Despite extensive study on specific issues like bias, the intrinsic values of LLMs remain largely unexplored from a moral philosophy perspective. This work delves into ethical values utilizing Moral Foundation Theory. Moving beyond conventional discriminative evaluations with poor reliability, we propose DeNEVIL, a novel prompt generation algorithm tailored to dynamically exploit LLMs’ value vulnerabilities and elicit the violation of ethics in a generative manner, revealing their underlying value inclinations. On such a basis, we construct MoralPrompt, a high-quality dataset comprising 2,397 prompts covering 500+ value principles, and then benchmark the intrinsic values across a spectrum of LLMs. We discovered that most models are essentially misaligned, necessitating further ethical value alignment. In response, we develop VILMO, an in-context alignment method that substantially enhances the value compliance of LLM outputs by learning to generate appropriate value instructions, outperforming existing competitors.

However, scalable representation for 3D objects and scenes is relatively unexplored. In this work, we present Uni3D, a 3D foundation model to explore the unified 3D representation at scale. Uni3D uses a 2D initialized ViT end-to-end pretrained to align the 3D point cloud features with the image-text aligned features. Via the simple architecture and pretext task, Uni3D can leverage abundant 2D pretrained models as initialization and image-text aligned models as the target, unlocking the great potential of 2D model zoos and scaling-up strategies to the 3D world. We efficiently scale up Uni3D to one billion parameters, and set new records on a broad range of 3D tasks, such as zero-shot classification, few-shot classification, open-world understanding and zero-shot part segmentation.

ICLR,2024,Synapse: Trajectory-as-Exemplar Prompting with Memory for Computer Control,"Building agents with large language models (LLMs) for computer control is a burgeoning research area, where the agent receives computer states and performs actions to complete complex tasks. Previous computer agents have demonstrated the benefits of in-context learning (ICL); however, their performance is hindered by several issues. First, the limited context length of LLMs and complex computer states restrict the number of exemplars, as a single webpage can consume the entire context. Second, the exemplars in current methods, such as high-level plans and multi-choice questions, cannot represent complete trajectories, leading to suboptimal performance in long-horizon tasks. Third, existing computer agents rely on task-specific exemplars and overlook the similarity among tasks, resulting in poor generalization to novel tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Synapse, a computer agent featuring three key components: i) state abstraction, which filters out task-irrelevant information from raw states, allowing more exemplars within the limited context, ii) trajectory-as-exemplar prompting, which prompts the LLM with complete trajectories of the abstracted states and actions to improve multi-step decision-making, and iii) exemplar memory, which stores the embeddings of exemplars and retrieves them via similarity search for generalization to novel tasks. We evaluate Synapse on MiniWoB++, a standard task suite, and Mind2Web, a real-world website benchmark. In MiniWoB++, Synapse achieves a 99.2% average success rate (a 10% relative improvement) across 64 tasks using demonstrations from only 48 tasks.

ICLR,2024,Scalable Language Model with Generalized Continual Learning,"Continual learning has gained increasing importance as it facilitates the acquisition and refinement of scalable knowledge and skills in language models. However, existing methods typically encounter strict limitations and challenges in real-world scenarios, such as reliance on experience replay, optimization constraints, and inference task-ID. In this study, we introduce the Scalable Language Model (SLM) to overcome these limitations within a more challenging and generalized setting, representing a significant advancement toward practical applications for continual learning.

This approach leverages the task distribution within the vector space, aiming to achieve a smooth and effortless continual learning process. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse backbones and benchmarks, achieving effective continual learning in both full-set and few-shot scenarios with minimal forgetting. Moreover, while prior research primarily focused on a single task type such as classification, our study goes beyond, with the large language model, i.e., LLaMA-2, to explore the effects across diverse domains and task types, such that a single language model can be decently scaled to broader applications.

ICLR,2024,GPT-4 Is Too Smart To Be Safe: Stealthy Chat with LLMs via Cipher,"Safety lies at the core of the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences, including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which are mainly conducted in natural languages. We propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across 11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time in bypassing the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role play and several unsafe demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability.

Specifically, we represent text spans (i.e., referring expressions and noun phrases) as links in Markdown, i.e., [text span](bounding boxes), where object descriptions are sequences of location tokens. To train the model, we construct a large-scale dataset about grounded image-text pairs (GrIT) together with multimodal corpora. In addition to the existing capabilities of MLLMs (e.g., perceiving general modalities, following instructions, and performing in-context learning), Kosmos-2 integrates the grounding capability to downstream applications, while maintaining the conventional capabilities of MLLMs (e.g., perceiving general modalities, following instructions, and performing in-context learning). Kosmos-2 is evaluated on a wide range of tasks, including (i) multimodal grounding, such as referring expression comprehension and phrase grounding, (ii) multimodal referring, such as referring expression generation, (iii) perception-language tasks, and (iv) language understanding and generation.

ICLR,2024,Context is Environment,"Two lines of work are taking the central stage in AI research. On the one hand, the community is making increasing efforts to build models that discard spurious correlations and generalize better in novel test environments. Unfortunately, the hard lesson so far is that no proposal convincingly outperforms a simple empirical risk minimization baseline. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have erupted as algorithms able to learn in-context, generalizing on-the-fly to eclectic contextual circumstances that users enforce by means of prompting. In this paper, we argue that context is environment, and posit that in-context learning holds the key to better domain generalization. Via extensive theory and experiments, we show that paying attention to context$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$unlabeled examples as they arrive$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$allows our proposed In-Context Risk Minimization (ICRM) algorithm to zoom-in on the test environment risk minimizer, leading to significant out-of-distribution performance improvements. Furthermore, training with context helps the model learn a better featurizer. From all of this, two messages are worth taking home.

ICLR,2024,Time Travel in LLMs: Tracing Data Contamination in Large Language Models,"Data contamination, i.e., the presence of test data from downstream tasks in the training data of large language models (LLMs), is a potential major issue in measuring LLMs' real effectiveness on other tasks. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination within LLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contamination at the instance level; using this information, our approach then assesses wider contamination at the partition level. To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ ""guided instruction:"" a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type, and the random-length initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or nearly matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE-L or BLEURT) is statistically significantly better with the completions from guided instruction compared to a ""general instruction"" that does not include the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with few-shot in-context learning prompt marks multiple generated completions as exact/near-exact matches of the corresponding reference instances. Our best method achieves an accuracy between 92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets, containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manual evaluation by human experts. Further, our findings indicate that GPT-4 is contaminated with AG News, WNLI, and XSum datasets.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,Towards Few-Shot Adaptation of Foundation Models via Multitask Finetuning,"Foundation models have emerged as a powerful tool for many AI problems. Despite the tremendous success of foundation models, effective adaptation to new tasks, particularly those with limited labels, remains an open question and lacks theoretical understanding. 
  An emerging solution with recent success in vision and NLP involves finetuning a foundation model on a selection of relevant tasks, before its adaptation to a target task with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we study the theoretical justification of this multitask finetuning approach. 
Our theoretical analysis reveals that with a diverse set of related tasks, this multitask finetuning leads to reduced error in the target task, in comparison to directly adapting the same pretrained model. We quantify the relationship between finetuning tasks and target tasks by diversity and consistency metrics, and further propose a practical task selection algorithm.
  We substantiate our theoretical claims with extensive empirical evidence.
Further, we present results affirming our task selection algorithm adeptly chooses related finetuning tasks, providing advantages to the model performance on target tasks.
  We believe our study shed new light on the effective adaptation of foundation models to new tasks that lack abundant labels.

ICLR,2024,Matcher: Segment Anything with One Shot Using All-Purpose Feature Matching,"Powered by large-scale pre-training, vision foundation models exhibit significant potential in open-world image understanding. However, unlike large language models that excel at directly tackling various language tasks, vision foundation models require a task-specific model structure followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks. In this work, we present $\textbf{Matcher}$, a novel perception paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address various perception tasks. Matcher can segment anything by using an in-context example without training. Additionally, we design three effective components within the Matcher framework to collaborate with these foundation models and unleash their full potential in diverse perception tasks. Matcher demonstrates impressive generalization performance across various segmentation tasks, all without training. For example, it achieves 52.7% mIoU on COCO-20$^i$ with one example, surpassing the state-of-the-art specialist model by 1.6%. In addition, Matcher achieves 33.0% mIoU on the proposed LVIS-92$^i$ for one-shot semantic segmentation, outperforming the state-of-the-art generalist model by 14.4%. Our visualization results further showcase the open-world generality and flexibility of Matcher when applied to images in the wild.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,IDEAL: Influence-Driven Selective Annotations Empower In-Context Learners in Large Language Models,"In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influence-driven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2024,Image Translation as Diffusion Visual Programmers,"We introduce the novel Diffusion Visual Programmer (DVP), a neuro-symbolic image translation framework. Our proposed DVP seamlessly embeds a condition-flexible diffusion model within the GPT architecture, orchestrating a coherent sequence of visual programs ($i.e.$, computer vision models) for various pro-symbolic steps, which span RoI identification, style transfer, and position manipulation, facilitating transparent and controllable image translation processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate DVP’s remarkable performance, surpassing concurrent arts. This success can be attributed to several key features of DVP: First, DVP achieves condition-flexible translation via instance normalization, enabling the model to eliminate sensitivity caused by the manual guidance and optimally focus on textual descriptions for high-quality content generation. Second, the frame work enhances in-context reasoning by deciphering intricate high-dimensional concepts in feature spaces into more accessible low-dimensional symbols ($e.g.$, [Prompt], [RoI object]), allowing for localized, context-free editing while maintaining overall coherence. Last but not least, DVP improves systemic controllability and explainability by offering explicit symbolic representations at each programming stage, empowering users to intuitively interpret and modify results. Our research marks a substantial step towards harmonizing artificial image translation processes with cognitive intelligence, promising broader applications.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2024,DePT: Decomposed Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning,"Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous) prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences, which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue, we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better performance while saving substantial memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive experiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL) tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline, in some scenarios. Additionally, we empirically show that DEPT grows more efficient as the model size increases. Our further study reveals that DePT integrates seamlessly with parameter-efficient transfer learning in the few-shot learning setting and highlights its adaptability to various model architectures and sizes.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,Spatio-Temporal Few-Shot Learning via Diffusive Neural Network Generation,"Spatio-temporal modeling is foundational for smart city applications, yet it is often hindered by data scarcity in many cities and regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities.  We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks.  By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction.

ICLR,2024,Function Vectors in Large Language Models,"We report the presence of a simple neural mechanism that represents an input-output function as a vector within autoregressive transformer language models (LMs). Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse range of in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, we find that a small number attention heads transport a compact representation of the demonstrated task, which we call a function vector (FV).  FVs are robust to changes in context, i.e., they trigger execution of the task on inputs such as zero-shot and natural text settings that do not resemble the ICL contexts from which they are collected. We test FVs across a range of tasks, models, and layers and find strong causal effects across settings in middle layers. We investigate the internal structure of FVs and find while that they often contain information that encodes the output space of the function, this information alone is not sufficient to reconstruct an FV. Finally, we test semantic vector composition in FVs, and find that to some extent they can be summed to create vectors that trigger new complex tasks. Our findings show that compact, causal internal vector representations of function abstractions can be explicitly extracted from LLMs.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2024,Language Modeling Is Compression,"It has long been established that predictive models can be transformed into lossless compressors and vice versa. Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively. Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.",⚡ 效率优化
ICLR,2024,BatchPrompt: Accomplish more with less,"The ever-increasing token limits of large language models (LLMs) have enabled long context as input. Many LLMs are trained and fine-tuned to perform zero/few-shot inference using instruction-based prompts. Prompts typically include a detailed task instruction, several examples, and a single data point for inference. This baseline is referred to as “SinglePrompt” in this paper. In terms of token count, when the data input is small compared to instructions and examples, this results in lower token utilization, compared with encoder-based models like fine-tuned BERT. This cost inefficiency, affecting inference speed and compute budget, counteracts many of the benefits that LLMs offer. This paper aims to alleviate this problem by batching multiple data points in each prompt, a strategy we refer to as “BatchPrompt”. We improve token utilization by increasing the “density” of data points, however, this cannot be done naively. Simple batching can degrade performance, especially as batch size increases, and data points can yield different answers depending on their position within a prompt. To address the quality issue while retaining high token utilization, we introduce Batch Permutation and Ensembling (BPE) for BatchPrompt – a simple majority vote over repeated permutations of data, that recovers label quality at the cost of more token usage. To counterbalance this cost, we further propose Self-reflection-guided EArly Stopping (SEAS), which can terminate the voting process early for data points that the LLM handles confidently. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that BPE + SEAS can boost the performance of BatchPrompt by a striking margin on a range of popular NLP tasks, including question answering (Boolq), textual entailment (RTE), and duplicate questions identification (QQP). This performance is even competitive with/higher than single-data prompting (SinglePrompt), while using far fewer LLM calls and input tokens. At batch size 32, our BatchPrompt + BPE + SEAS uses 15.7% the number of LLM calls, and achieves: Boolq accuracy 90.6% → 90.9% with 27.4% tokens, QQP accuracy 87.2% → 88.4% with 18.6% tokens, RTE accuracy 91.5% → 91.1% with 30.8% tokens.

ICLR,2024,ContextRef: Evaluating Referenceless Metrics for Image Description Generation,"Referenceless metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) use pretrained vision--language models to assess image descriptions directly without costly ground-truth reference texts. Such methods can facilitate rapid progress, but only if they truly align with human preference judgments. In this paper, we introduce ContextRef, a benchmark for assessing referenceless metrics for such alignment. ContextRef has two components: human ratings along a variety of established quality dimensions, and ten diverse robustness checks designed to uncover fundamental weaknesses. A crucial aspect of ContextRef is that images and descriptions are presented in context, reflecting prior work showing that context is important for description quality. Using ContextRef, we assess a variety of pretrained models, scoring functions, and techniques for incorporating context. None of the methods is successful with ContextRef, but we show that careful fine-tuning yields substantial improvements. ContextRef remains a challenging benchmark though, in large part due to the challenge of context dependence.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2024,CausalLM is not optimal for in-context learning,"Recent empirical evidence indicates that transformer based in-context learning performs better when using a prefix language model (prefixLM), in which in-context samples can all attend to each other, compared to causal language models (causalLM), which use auto-regressive attention that prohibits in-context samples to attend to future samples. While this result is intuitive, it is not understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper we take a theoretical approach and analyze the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM under a certain parameter construction. Our analysis shows that both LM types converge to their stationary points at a linear rate, but that while prefixLM converges to the optimal solution of linear regression, causalLM convergence dynamics follows that of an online gradient descent algorithm, which is not guaranteed to be optimal even as the number of samples grows infinitely. We supplement our theoretical claims with empirical experiments over synthetic and real tasks and using various types of transformers. Our experiments verify that causalLM consistently underperforms prefixLM in all settings.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2024,Consistency-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models,"We propose Consistency-guided Prompt learning (CoPrompt), a new fine-tuning method for vision-language models. Our approach improves the generalization of large foundation models when fine-tuned on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. The basic idea of CoPrompt is to enforce a consistency constraint in the prediction of the trainable and pre-trained models to prevent overfitting on the downstream task. Additionally, we introduce the following two components into our consistency constraint to further boost the performance: enforcing consistency on two perturbed inputs and combining two dominant paradigms of tuning, prompting and adapter. Enforcing consistency on perturbed input serves to further regularize the consistency constraint, thereby improving generalization. Moreover, the integration of adapters and prompts not only enhances performance on downstream tasks but also offers increased tuning flexibility in both input and output spaces. This facilitates more effective adaptation to downstream tasks in a few-shot learning setting. Experiments show that CoPrompt outperforms existing methods on a range of evaluation suites, including base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset evaluation. On generalization, CoPrompt improves the state-of-the-art on zero-shot tasks and the overall harmonic mean over 11 datasets. Detailed ablation studies show the effectiveness of each of the components in CoPrompt. We make our code available at https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/CoPrompt.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2024,Mask-Based Modeling for Neural Radiance Fields,"Most Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) exhibit limited generalization capabilities,which restrict their applicability in representing multiple scenes using a single model. To address this problem, existing generalizable NeRF methods simply condition the model on image features. These methods still struggle to learn precise global representations over diverse scenes since they lack an effective mechanism for interacting among different points and views. In this work, we unveil that 3D implicit representation learning can be significantly improved by mask-based modeling. Specifically, we propose **m**asked **r**ay and **v**iew **m**odeling for generalizable **NeRF** (**MRVM-NeRF**), which is a self-supervised pretraining target to predict complete scene representations from partially masked features along each ray. With this pretraining target, MRVM-NeRF enables better use of correlations across different rays and views as the geometry priors, which thereby strengthens the capability of capturing intricate details within the scenes and boosts the generalization capability across different scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MRVM-NeRF on both synthetic and real-world datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, we also conduct experiments to show the compatibility of our proposed method with various backbones and its superiority under few-shot cases.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2024,CrIBo: Self-Supervised Learning via Cross-Image Object-Level Bootstrapping,"Leveraging nearest neighbor retrieval for self-supervised representation learning has proven beneficial with object-centric images. However, this approach faces limitations when applied to scene-centric datasets, where multiple objects within an image are only implicitly captured in the global representation. Such global bootstrapping can lead to undesirable entanglement of object representations. Furthermore, even object-centric datasets stand to benefit from a finer-grained bootstrapping approach. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel $\textbf{Cr}$oss-$\textbf{I}$mage Object-Level $\textbf{Bo}$otstrapping method tailored to enhance dense visual representation learning. By employing object-level nearest neighbor bootstrapping throughout the training, CrIBo emerges as a notably strong and adequate candidate for in-context learning, leveraging nearest neighbor retrieval at test time. CrIBo shows state-of-the-art performance on the latter task while being highly competitive in more standard downstream segmentation tasks.

ICLR,2024,Towards Offline Opponent Modeling with In-context Learning,"Opponent modeling aims at learning the opponent's behaviors, goals, or beliefs to reduce the uncertainty of the competitive environment and assist decision-making. Existing work has mostly focused on learning opponent models online, which is impractical and inefficient in practical scenarios. To this end, we formalize an Offline Opponent Modeling (OOM) problem with the objective of utilizing pre-collected offline datasets to learn opponent models that characterize the opponent from the viewpoint of the controlled agent, which aids in adapting to the unknown fixed policies of the opponent. Drawing on the promises of the Transformers for decision-making, we introduce a general approach, Transformer Against Opponent (TAO), for OOM. Essentially, TAO tackles the problem by harnessing the full potential of the supervised pre-trained Transformers' in-context learning capabilities. The foundation of TAO lies in three stages: an innovative offline policy embedding learning stage, an offline opponent-aware response policy training stage, and a deployment stage for opponent adaptation with in-context learning. Theoretical analysis establishes TAO's equivalence to Bayesian posterior sampling in opponent modeling and guarantees TAO's convergence in opponent policy recognition. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on competitive environments with sparse and dense rewards demonstrate the impressive performance of TAO. Our approach manifests remarkable prowess for fast adaptation, especially in the face of unseen opponent policies, confirming its in-context learning potency.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2024,MuSc: Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Classification and Segmentation with Mutual Scoring of the Unlabeled Images,"This paper studies zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) in industrial vision.
We reveal that the abundant normal and abnormal cues implicit in unlabeled test images can be exploited for anomaly determination, which is ignored by prior methods.
Our key observation is that for the industrial product images, the normal image patches could find a relatively large number of similar patches in other unlabeled images,
while the abnormal ones only have a few similar patches.
We leverage such a discriminative characteristic to design a novel zero-shot AC/AS method by Mutual Scoring (MuSc) of the unlabeled images,  
which does not need any training or prompts.
Specifically, we perform Local Neighborhood Aggregation with Multiple Degrees (LNAMD) to obtain the patch features that are capable of representing anomalies in varying sizes.
Then we propose the Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) to leverage the unlabeled test images to assign the anomaly score to each other. 
Furthermore, we present an optimization approach named Re-scoring with Constrained Image-level Neighborhood (RsCIN) for image-level anomaly classification to suppress the false positives caused by noises in normal images.
The superior performance on the challenging MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. 
Compared with the state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches, 
MuSc achieves a $\textbf{21.1}$% PRO absolute gain (from 72.7\% to 93.8\%) on MVTec AD, a $\textbf{19.4}$% pixel-AP gain and a $\textbf{14.7}$% pixel-AUROC gain on VisA.

ICLR,2025,Rapid Selection and Ordering of In-Context Demonstrations via Prompt Embedding Clustering,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL) using just a few demonstrations, their performances are sensitive to demonstration orders. The reasons behind this sensitivity remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the prompt embedding space to bridge the gap between the order sensitivity of ICL with inner workings of decoder-only LLMs, uncovering the clustering property: prompts sharing the first and last demonstrations have closer embeddings, with first-demonstration clustering usually being stronger in practice. We explain this property through extensive theoretical analyses and empirical evidences. Our finding suggests that the positional encoding and the causal attention mask are key contributors to the clustering phenomenon. Leveraging this clustering insight, we introduce Cluster-based Search, a novel method that accelerates the selection and ordering of demonstrations in self-adaptive ICL settings.

ICLR,2025,Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon,"Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 
1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts).
2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 
3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance.
4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. 

Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios,

ICLR,2025,One-for-All Few-Shot Anomaly Detection via Instance-Induced Prompt Learning,"Anomaly detection methods under the 'one-for-all' paradigm aim to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies across multiple classes.

In this paper, we first proposed the one-for-all few-shot anomaly detection method with the assistance of vision-language model. Different from previous CLIP-based methods learning fix prompts for each class, our method learn a class-shared prompt generator to adaptively generate suitable prompt for each instance. The prompt generator is trained by aligning the prompts with the visual space and utilizing guidance from general textual descriptions of normality and abnormality.

SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application.

ICLR,2025,Why In-Context Learning Models are Good Few-Shot Learners?,"We explore in-context learning (ICL) models from a learning-to-learn perspective. Unlike studies that identify specific learning algorithms in ICL models, we compare ICL models with typical meta-learners to understand their superior performance. We theoretically prove the expressiveness of ICL models as learning algorithms and examine their learnability and generalizability. 
Our findings show that ICL with transformers 
can effectively construct data-dependent learning algorithms instead of directly follow existing ones 
(including gradient-based, metric-based, and amortization-based meta-learners). 
The construction of such learning algorithm is determined by the pre-training process, as a function fitting the training distribution, which raises generalizability as an important issue.
With above understanding, we propose strategies to transfer techniques for classical deep networks to meta-level to further improve ICL.

In this work, we introduce bijection learning, a powerful attack algorithm which automatically fuzzes LLMs for safety vulnerabilities using randomly-generated encodings whose complexity can be tightly controlled. We leverage in-context learning to teach models bijective encodings, pass encoded queries to the model to bypass built-in safety mechanisms, and finally decode responses back into English. Our attack is extremely effective on a wide range of frontier language models. By controlling complexity parameters such as number of key-value mappings in the encodings, we find a close relationship between the capability level of the attacked LLM and the average complexity of the most effective bijection attacks. Our work highlights that new vulnerabilities in frontier models can emerge with scale: more capable models are more severely jailbroken by bijection attacks.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,Generative Adapter: Contextualizing Language Models in Parameters with A Single Forward Pass,"Large language models (LLMs) acquire substantial knowledge during pretraining but often need adaptation to new contexts, tasks, or domains, typically achieved through fine-tuning or prompting. However, fine-tuning incurs significant training costs, while prompting increases inference overhead. Inspired by fast weight memory, we introduce GenerativeAdapter, an effective and efficient adaptation method that encode test-time context into language model parameters with a single forward pass.
GenerativeAdapter augments a frozen pretrained LM with a lightweight adapter generator, trained via self-supervised learning, to produce parameter-efficient adapters.
Notably, our generator is general-purpose, i.e., one generator can adapt the corresponding base model for all langauge processing scenarios.
We apply GenerativeAdapter to two pretrained LMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama2-7B-Chat) and evaluate the adapted models across  knowledge acquisition from documents, learning from demonstrations, and personalization for users.
In StreamingQA, our approach is effective in injecting knowledge into the LM's parameters, achieving a 63.5\% improvement in F1 score over the model with supervised fine-tuning (from $19.5$ to $31.5$) for contexts as long as 32K tokens.
In the MetaICL in-context learning evaluation, our method achieves an average accuracy of $44.9$ across 26 tasks, outperforming the base model. 
On MSC, our method proves to be highly competitive in memorizing user information from conversations with a 4x reduction in computation and memory costs compared to 
prompting with full conversation history.
Overall, GenerativeAdapter provides a viable solution for adapting large LMs to evolving information and providing tailored user experience, while reducing training and inference costs relative to traditional fine-tuning and prompting techniques.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,ICLR: In-Context Learning of Representations,"Recent work demonstrates that structured patterns in pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model’s (LLM) internals, with such representations then driving downstream abilities. Given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn novel tasks, we ask whether models can flexibly alter their semantically grounded organization of concepts. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, can models infer these novel semantics and reorganize representations in accordance with them? To answer this question, we define a toy “graph tracing” task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.), and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization of representations according to the graph’s structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, which shows getting non-trivial performance on the task requires for the model to infer a connected component. Overall, our findings indicate context-size may be an underappreciated scaling axis that can flexibly re-organize model representations, unlocking novel capabilities.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

Nonetheless, these existing techniques rely on surface-level string matching, and thus they suffer from the major limitation of not being able to handle orthographic variations and paraphrasing---notable and common phenomena in any natural language.
In addition, existing continuous approaches such as dense vector search tend to be overly coarse, often retrieving texts that are unrelated but share similar topics.
Given these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves soft (or semantic) yet efficient pattern matching by relaxing a surface-level matching with word embeddings.
Our algorithm is highly scalable with respect to the size of the corpus text utilizing inverted indexes.
We have prepared an efficient implementation, and we provide an accessible web tool.
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
(i) can execute searches on billion-scale corpora in less than a second, which is comparable in speed to surface-level string matching and dense vector search;
(ii) can extract harmful instances that semantically match queries from a large set of English and Japanese Wikipedia articles;
and (iii) can be effectively applied to corpus-linguistic analyses of Latin, a language with highly diverse inflections.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Making Text Embedders Few-Shot Learners,"Large language models (LLMs) with decoder-only architectures have demonstrated exceptional text-generation capabilities across a variety of tasks. Some researchers have also adapted these models for text representation tasks. However, in text representation tasks, these models often face performance degradation on unseen tasks. In-context learning (ICL), which leverages examples provided in the input context, enables LLMs to handle unseen tasks effectively. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize the inherent properties of LLMs to enhance text representation performance across different tasks through the ICL approach.

In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective training strategy, which significantly improves text representation capabilities. Unlike previous models that prepend task instructions to the text, our method randomly samples a varying number of examples during training, endowing the embedding model with in-context learning abilities while maintaining its zero-shot capabilities. This approach does not require additional data construction or modifications to the model architecture. On the contrary, we find that some popular modifications to the model, such as bidirectional attention, can degrade performance, undermining the inherent characteristics of LLMs. We have publicly released our method at this \href{https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding}{repo}.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Searching for Optimal Solutions with LLMs via Bayesian Optimization,"Scaling test-time compute to search for optimal solutions is an important step towards building generally-capable language models that can reason. Recent work, however, shows that tasks of varying complexity require distinct search strategies to solve optimally, thus making it challenging to design a one-size-fits-all approach. Prior solutions either attempt to predict task difficulty to select the optimal search strategy, often infeasible in practice, or use a static, pre-defined strategy, e.g., repeated parallel sampling or greedy sequential search, which is sub-optimal. In this work, we argue for an alternative view using the probabilistic framework of Bayesian optimization (BO), where the search strategy is adapted dynamically based on the evolving uncertainty estimates of solutions as search progresses. To this end, we introduce Bayesian-OPRO (BOPRO)––a generalization of a recent method for in-context optimization, which iteratively samples from new proposal distributions by modifying the prompt to the LLM with a subset of its previous generations selected to explore or exploit different parts of the search space. We evaluate our method on word search, molecule optimization, and a joint hypothesis+program search task using a 1-D version of the challenging Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (1D-ARC). Our results show that BOPRO outperforms all baselines in word search (≥10 points) and molecule optimization (higher quality and 17% fewer invalid molecules), but trails a best-k prompting strategy in program search. Our analysis reveals that despite the ability to balance exploration and exploitation using BOPRO, failure is likely due to the inability of code representation models in distinguishing sequences with low edit-distances.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,Measuring and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in RAG through Grounded Attributions and Learning to Refuse,"LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (↑12.56), QAMPARI (↑36.04), and ELI5 (↑17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models’ ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning,"In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model’s behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competitive dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Attention in Large Language Models Yields Efficient Zero-Shot Re-Rankers,"Information retrieval (IR) systems have played a vital role in modern digital life and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative AI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing capabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have become popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far, LLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which restricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given these restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal for LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals relevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full potential via generation. To more  directly leverage such signals, we propose in-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method  that leverages the change in attention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient re-ranking. We assume that more relevant documents should receive more attention weights when an LLM is processing the query tokens, and leverage such signals for re-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration method using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only requires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it substantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at least $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to any LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking. Extensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop and multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms RankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through detailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks that require more complex re-ranking signals, such as handling contextualization and contradiction between the query and passages, as well as information integration across multiple passages. Our findings call for further exploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,From Few to Many: Self-Improving Many-Shot Reasoners Through Iterative Optimization and Generation,"Recent advances in long-context large language models (LLMs) have led to the emerging paradigm of many-shot in-context learning (ICL), where it is observed that scaling many more demonstrating examples beyond the conventional few-shot setup in the context can lead to performance benefits. However, despite its promise, it is unclear what aspects dominate the benefits and whether simply scaling to more examples is the most effective way of improving many-shot ICL. In this work, we first provide an analysis on the factors driving many-shot ICL, and we find that 1) many-shot performance can still be attributed to often a few disproportionately influential examples and 2) identifying such influential examples (""optimize"") and using them as demonstrations to regenerate new examples (""generate"") can lead to further improvements. Inspired by the findings, we propose BRIDGE, an algorithm that alternates between the optimize step with Bayesian optimization to discover the influential sets of examples and the generate step to reuse this set to expand the reasoning paths of the examples back to the many-shot regime automatically. On Gemini, Claude, and Mistral LLMs of different sizes, we show BRIDGE led to significant improvements across a diverse set of tasks including symbolic reasoning, numerical reasoning and code generation.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Toward Understanding In-context vs. In-weight Learning,"It has recently been demonstrated empirically that in-context learning emerges in transformers when certain distributional properties are present in the training data, but this ability can also diminish upon further training. We provide a new theoretical understanding of these phenomena by identifying simplified distributional properties that give rise to the emergence and eventual disappearance of in-context learning. We do so by first analyzing a simplified model that uses a gating mechanism to choose between an in-weight and an in-context predictor. Through a combination of a generalization error and regret analysis we identify conditions where in-context and in-weight learning emerge. These theoretical findings are then corroborated experimentally by comparing the behaviour of a full transformer on the simplified distributions to that of the stylized model, demonstrating aligned results. We then extend the study to a full large language model, showing how fine-tuning on various collections of natural language prompts can elicit similar in-context and in-weight learning behaviour.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,DataMan: Data Manager for Pre-training Large Language Models,"The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. 
However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines.
To address this, we are inspired by *``reverse thinking''* -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. 
As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing.
In this paper, we train a **Data** **Man**ager (**DataMan**) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type.
Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. 
The best-performing model, based on the *Overall Score l=5* surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. 
We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. 
Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. 
We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,LICO: Large Language Models for In-Context Molecular Optimization,"Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO performs competitively on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising 23 objective functions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on its low-budget version PMO-1K.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Spread Preference Annotation: Direct Preference Judgment for Efficient LLM Alignment,"Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework, Spread Preference Annotation with direct preference judgment (SPA), that boosts the alignment of LLMs using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data.
Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data.
To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. 
Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective.
In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs.
For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,PEARL: Towards Permutation-Resilient LLMs,"The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations. However, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to instability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be exploited to design a natural attack—difficult for model providers to detect—that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the demonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing and fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations, raising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance against the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a permutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most challenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which is solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax optimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other, progressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic pre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL effectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably, despite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves performance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Follow My Instruction and Spill the Beans: Scalable Data Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves pre-trained models by incorporating external knowledge at test time to enable customized adaptation. 
We study the risk of datastore leakage in Retrieval-In-Context RAG Language Models (LMs). We show that an adversary can exploit LMs' instruction-following capabilities to easily extract text data verbatim from the datastore of RAG systems built with instruction-tuned LMs via prompt injection. 
The vulnerability exists for a wide range of modern LMs that span Llama2, Mistral/Mixtral, Vicuna, SOLAR, WizardLM, Qwen1.5, and Platypus2, and the exploitability exacerbates as the model size scales up. 
We also study multiple effects of RAG setup on the extractability of data, indicating that following unexpected instructions to regurgitate data can be an outcome of failure in effectively utilizing contexts for modern LMs, and further show that such vulnerability can be greatly mitigated by position bias elimination strategies. 
Extending our study to production RAG models, GPTs, we design an attack that can cause datastore leakage with a near-perfect success rate on 25 randomly selected customized GPTs with at most 2 queries, and we extract text data verbatim at a rate of 41\% from a book of 77,000 words and 3\% from a corpus of 1,569,000 words by prompting the GPTs with only 100 queries generated by themselves.",🎯 特定技术方法

To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate ""time series forecasting tasks"" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,AgentOccam: A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for LLM-Based Web Agents,"Autonomy via agents based on large language models (LLMs) that can carry out personalized yet standardized tasks presents a significant opportunity to drive human efficiency. There is an emerging need and interest in automating web tasks  (e.g., booking a hotel for a given date within a budget). Being a practical use case itself, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Meanwhile, much prior research focuses on handcrafting their web agent strategies (e.g., agent's prompting templates, reflective workflow, role-play and multi-agent systems, search or sampling methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples. However, these custom strategies often struggle with generalizability across all potential real-world applications. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation and action representation, and the data on which the agent's underlying LLM has been pre-trained. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. In our study, we enhance an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space, aligning these more closely with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. Furthermore, on WebVoyager benchmark comprising tasks defined on real-world websites, AgentOccam exceeds the former best agent by 2.4 points (+4.6%) on tasks with deterministic answers. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,On Linear Representations and Pretraining Data Frequency in Language Models,"Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some concepts are encoded ""linearly"" in the representations, but what factors cause these representations to form (or not)? We study the connection between pretraining data frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations (e.g., mapping France to Paris in a capital prediction task). We find evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations. This is the case across all phases of pretraining, i.e., it is not affected by the model's underlying capability. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J (6B), we discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during pretraining (and around 4k times for OLMo-1B). Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds. We release our code to support future work.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,APE: Faster and Longer Context-Augmented Generation via Adaptive Parallel Encoding,"Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding (**APE**), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98\% and 93\% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6\% and 7.9\%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel. Efficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\times$ speedup by reducing 28$\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context. The code is available at

ICLR,2025,Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling,"Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has long been a challenging problem. Previous approaches have either suffered from quadratic computational complexity or limited extrapolation ability in length generalization. In this

ICLR,2025,Large (Vision) Language Models are Unsupervised In-Context Learners,"Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled zero-shot inference, allowing models to solve new tasks without task-specific training. Various adaptation techniques such as prompt engineering, In-Context Learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning can further enhance the model’s performance on a downstream task, but they require substantial manual effort to construct effective prompts or labeled examples. In this work, we introduce a joint inference framework for fully unsupervised adaptation, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering and labeled examples. Unlike zero-shot inference, which makes independent predictions, the joint inference makes predictions simultaneously for all inputs in a given task. Since direct joint inference involves computationally expensive optimization, we develop efficient approximation techniques, leading to two unsupervised adaptation methods: unsupervised fine-tuning and unsupervised ICL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse tasks and models, including language-only Llama-3.1 on natural language processing tasks, reasoning-oriented Qwen2.5-Math on grade school math problems, vision-language OpenFlamingo on vision tasks, and the API-only access GPT-4o model on massive multi-discipline tasks.

ICLR,2025,Vision Language Models are In-Context Value Learners,"Predicting temporal progress from visual trajectories is important for intelligent robots that can learn, adapt, and improve. However, learning such progress estimator, or temporal value function, across different tasks and domains requires both a large amount of diverse data and methods which can scale and generalize. To address these challenges, we present Generative Value Learning (GVL), a universal value function estimator that leverages the world knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress. Naively asking a VLM to predict values for a video sequence performs poorly due to the strong temporal correlation between successive frames. Instead, GVL poses value estimation as a temporal ordering problem over shuffled video frames; this seemingly more challenging task encourages VLMs to more fully exploit their underlying semantic and temporal grounding capabilities to differentiate frames based on their perceived task progress, consequently producing significantly better value predictions. Without any robot or task specific training, GVL can in-context zero-shot and few-shot predict effective values for more than 300 distinct real-world tasks across diverse robot platforms, including challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GVL permits flexible multi-modal in-context learning via examples from heterogeneous tasks and embodiments, such as human videos. The generality of GVL enables various downstream applications pertinent to visuomotor policy learning, including dataset filtering, success detection, and value-weighted regression -- all without any model training or finetuning.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation,"The scaling of inference computation has unlocked the potential of long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings. For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge.  However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring the combination of multiple strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge, including in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs’ ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this,  we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations.  The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context LLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,Aligning Language Models with Demonstrated Feedback,"Language models are aligned to emulate the collective voice of many, resulting in outputs that align with no one in particular. Steering LLMs away from generic output is possible through supervised finetuning or RLHF, but requires prohibitively large datasets for new ad-hoc tasks. We argue that it is instead possible to align an LLM to a specific setting by leveraging a very small number ($<10$) of demonstrations as feedback. Our method, Demonstration ITerated Task Optimization (DITTO), directly aligns language model outputs to a user's demonstrated behaviors. Derived using ideas from online imitation learning, DITTO cheaply generates online comparison data by treating users' demonstrations as preferred over output from the LLM and its intermediate checkpoints. We evaluate DITTO's ability to learn fine-grained style and task alignment across domains such as news articles, emails, and blog posts. Additionally, we conduct a user study soliciting a range of demonstrations from participants ($N=16$). Across our benchmarks and user study, we find that win-rates for DITTO outperform few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and other self-play methods by an average of 19\% points. By using demonstrations as feedback directly, DITTO offers a novel method for effective customization of LLMs.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,HELMET: How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly,"Many benchmarks exist for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), yet developers often rely on synthetic tasks such as needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or an arbitrary subset of tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks reflect the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and such inconsistencies further complicate model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind these practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to limited coverage of applications, insufficient context lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we introduce HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also address several issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128K tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a comprehensive study of 59 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH do not reliably predict downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlations with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when tasks require full-context reasoning or following complex instructions---the gap widens as length increases. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and better predict other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,RNNs are not Transformers (Yet):  The Key Bottleneck on In-Context Retrieval,"This paper investigates the gap in representation powers of Transformers and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are more memory efficient than Transformers. We aim to understand whether RNNs can match the performance of Transformers, particularly when enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Our theoretical analysis reveals that CoT improves RNNs but is insufficient to close the gap with Transformers. A key bottleneck lies in the inability of RNNs to perfectly retrieve information from the context, even with CoT: 
for several tasks that explicitly or implicitly require this capability, such as associative recall and determining if a graph is a tree, we prove that RNNs are not expressive enough to solve the tasks while Transformers can solve them with ease.
Conversely, we prove that adopting techniques to enhance the in-context retrieval capability of RNNs, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and adding a single Transformer layer, can elevate RNNs to be capable of solving all polynomial-time solvable problems with CoT, hence closing the representation gap with Transformers. We validate our theory on synthetic and natural language experiments.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Mixture of In-Context Prompters for Tabular PFNs,"Recent benchmarks find In-Context Learning (ICL) outperforms both deep learning and tree-based algorithms on small tabular datasets. However, on larger datasets, ICL for tabular learning suffers in both efficiency and effectiveness. In terms of efficiency, transformers incur linear space and quadratic time complexity w.r.t. context size. In terms of effectiveness, contexts at inference encounter distribution shift compared to contexts from pretraining. We propose MixturePFN, which extends Sparse Mixture of Experts to the state-of-the-art ICL for tabular learning model. Specifically, MixturePFN finetunes a specialized ICL expert on each cluster of tabular data and routes new test samples to appropriate experts at inference. MixturePFN supports constant-size contexts by splitting large training datasets into more manageable clusters. MixturePFN addresses distribution shift by finetuning an expert on each training dataset cluster via bootstrapping. Extensive experimental results shows MixturePFN outperforms 19 baselines both in mean rank and as the Condorcet winner across 36 diverse tabular datasets under both accuracy and F1 score with statistical significance.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Trained Transformer Classifiers Generalize and Exhibit Benign Overfitting In-Context,"Transformers have the capacity to act as supervised learning algorithms: by properly encoding a set of labeled training (''in-context'') examples and an unlabeled test example into an input sequence of vectors of the same dimension, the forward pass of the transformer can produce predictions for that unlabeled test example.  A line of recent work has shown that when linear transformers are pre-trained on random instances for linear regression tasks, these trained transformers make predictions using an algorithm similar to that of ordinary least squares.  In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks.  Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time.  We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit ''benign overfitting in-context'': when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Learning Diagrams: A Graphical Language for Compositional Training Regimes,"Motivated by deep learning regimes with multiple interacting yet distinct model components, we introduce learning diagrams, graphical depictions of training setups that capture parameterized learning as data rather than code. A learning diagram compiles to a unique loss function on which component models are trained. The result of training on this loss is a collection of models whose predictions ``agree"" with one another. We show that a number of popular learning setups such as few-shot multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal learning can be depicted as learning diagrams. We further implement learning diagrams in a library that allows users to build diagrams of PyTorch and Flux.jl models. By implementing some classic machine learning use cases, we demonstrate how learning diagrams allow practitioners to build complicated models as compositions of smaller components, identify relationships between workflows, and manipulate models during or after training. Leveraging a category theoretic framework, we introduce a rigorous semantics for learning diagrams that puts such operations on a firm mathematical foundation.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Differential learning kinetics govern the transition from memorization to generalization during in-context learning,"Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative *rates* at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis,"Learning shared structure across environments facilitates rapid learning and adaptive behavior in neural systems. This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings.
Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of
related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on
few-shot reconstruction and forecasting of synthetic dynamical systems, and neural recordings from the motor cortex during different arm reaching tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Transformers Struggle to Learn to Search,"Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.

We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that for each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in the number of layers.

However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Learn-by-interact: A Data-Centric Framework For Self-Adaptive Agents in Realistic Environments,"Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis.   The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with.  We propose LEARN-BY-INTERACT, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations.   LEARN-BY-INTERACT synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld, and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of LEARN-BY-INTERACT in various downstream agentic tasks — baseline results are improved up to 11.1% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 23.1% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 10.6% improvement for training.  Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that LEARN-BY-INTERACT will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2025,On the Learn-to-Optimize Capabilities of Transformers in In-Context Sparse Recovery,"An intriguing property of the Transformer is its ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), where the Transformer can solve different inference tasks without parameter updating based on the contextual information provided by the corresponding input-output demonstration pairs. It has been theoretically proved that ICL is enabled by the capability of Transformers to perform gradient-descent algorithms (Von Oswald et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2024). This work takes a step further and shows that Transformers can perform learning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithms. Specifically, for the ICL sparse recovery (formulated as LASSO) tasks, we show that a K-layer Transformer can perform an L2O algorithm with a provable convergence rate linear in K. This provides a new perspective explaining the superior ICL capability of Transformers, even with only a few layers, which cannot be achieved by the standard gradient-descent algorithms. Moreover, unlike the conventional L2O algorithms that require the measurement matrix involved in training to match that in testing, the trained Transformer is able to solve sparse recovery problems generated with different measurement matrices.  Besides, Transformers as an L2O algorithm can leverage structural information embedded in the training tasks to accelerate its convergence during ICL, and generalize across different lengths of demonstration pairs, where conventional L2O algorithms typically struggle or fail. Such theoretical findings are supported by our experimental results.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,DELIFT: Data Efficient Language model Instruction Fine-Tuning,"Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for task specialization but often becomes resource-intensive due to redundant or uninformative data. Existing data selection methods typically rely either on computationally expensive gradient-based metrics or static embeddings that fail to adapt dynamically to the model’s evolving state, thus limiting their practical effectiveness. To address this,
we propose DELIFT (Data Efficient Language model Instruction Fine-Tuning), leveraging a novel, computationally efficient utility metric inspired by In-Context Learning (ICL). Our ICL-based metric measures the informational value of each data sample by quantifying its effectiveness as an in-context example in improving model predictions for other samples, reflecting its actual contribution relative to the model’s current state. Integrated with tailored submodular optimization methods, DELIFT systematically selects diverse, informative subsets optimized specifically for each fine-tuning stage: instruction tuning, task-specific adaptation, and continual fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model scales show DELIFT reduces fine-tuning data requirements by up to 70% without compromising performance, consistently outperforming existing methods by up to 26% in effectiveness and efficiency.",📊 评测基准与数据集

First, we introduce inductive biases through a graph representation and model ICIL as a graph generation problem using a learned diffusion process, enabling structured reasoning over demonstrations, observations, and actions. Second, we show that such a model can be trained using pseudo-demonstrations – arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation – as a virtually infinite pool of training data. Our experiments, in both simulation and reality, show that Instant Policy enables rapid learning of various everyday robot tasks. We also show how it can serve as a foundation for cross-embodiment and zero-shot transfer to language-defined tasks.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

In this paper, we explore utilizing visual signals as a new interface for models to interact with the environment. Specifically, we choose videos as a representative visual signal. And by training autoregressive Transformers on video datasets in a self-supervised objective, we find that the model emerges a zero-shot capability to infer the semantics from a demonstration video, and imitate the semantics to an unseen scenario. This allows the models to perform unseen tasks by watching the demonstration video in an in-context manner, without further fine-tuning. To validate the imitation capacity, we design various evaluation metrics including both objective and subjective measures. The results show that our models can generate high-quality video clips that accurately align with the semantic guidance provided by the demonstration videos, and we also show that the imitation capacity follows the scaling law.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

ICLR,2025,RetroInText: A Multimodal Large Language Model Enhanced Framework for Retrosynthetic Planning via In-Context Representation Learning,"Development of robust and effective strategies for retrosynthetic planning requires a deep understanding of the synthesis process. A critical step in achieving this goal is accurately identifying synthetic intermediates. Current machine learning-based methods often overlook the valuable context from the overall route, focusing only on predicting reactants from the product, requiring cost annotations for every reaction step, and ignoring the multi-faced nature of molecular, resulting in inaccurate synthetic route predictions. Therefore, we introduce RetroInText, an advanced end-to-end framework based on a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), featuring in-context learning with TEXT descriptions of synthetic routes. First, RetroInText including ChatGPT presents detailed descriptions of the reaction procedure. It learns the distinct compound representations in parallel with corresponding molecule encoders to extract multi-modal representations including 3D features. Subsequently, we propose an attention-based mechanism that offers a fusion module to complement these multi-modal representations with in-context learning and a fine-tuned language model for a single-step model. As a result, RetroInText accurately represents and effectively captures the complex relationship between molecules and the synthetic route. In experiments on the USPTO pathways dataset RetroBench, RetroInText outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 5% improvement in Top-1 test accuracy, particularly for long synthetic routes. These results demonstrate the superiority of RetroInText by integrating with context information over routes. They also demonstrate its potential for advancing pathway design and facilitating the development of organic chemistry.

ICLR,2025,ELICIT: LLM Augmentation Via External In-context Capability,"Enhancing the adaptive capabilities of large language models is a critical pursuit in both research and application.
Traditional fine-tuning methods require substantial data, computational resources, and specific capabilities, while in-context learning is limited by the need for appropriate demonstrations and efficient token usage.
    Inspired by the expression of in-context learned capabilities through task vectors and the concept of modular capability or knowledge, we propose ELICIT, a framework consisting of two modules designed to effectively store and reuse task vectors to enhance the diverse adaptive capabilities of models without additional training or inference tokens.
    Our comprehensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our pipeline is highly transferable across different input formats, tasks, and model architectures.
    Externally storing and reusing vectors that represent in-context learned capabilities not only shows the potential to extract modular capabilities but also significantly enhances the performance, versatility, adaptability, and scalability of large language models, paving the way for more efficient and effective use of these models in a wide range of applications.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidate the collective efforts of research community.

ICLR,2025,Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. 
This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; 
such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. 
We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. 
Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). 
We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. 
This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. 
We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.

ICLR,2025,A Theoretical Perspective: How to Prevent Model Collapse in Self-consuming Training Loops,"High-quality data is essential for training large generative models, yet the vast reservoir of real data available online has become nearly depleted. Consequently, models increasingly generate their own data for further training, forming Self-consuming Training Loops (STLs). However, the empirical results have been strikingly inconsistent: some models degrade or even collapse, while others successfully avoid these failures, leaving a significant gap in theoretical understanding to explain this discrepancy. This paper introduces the intriguing notion of *recursive stability* and presents the first theoretical generalization analysis, revealing how both model architecture and the proportion between real and synthetic data influence the success of STLs. We further extend this analysis to transformers in in-context learning, showing that even a constant-sized proportion of real data ensures convergence, while also providing insights into optimal synthetic data sizing.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,"Bio-xLSTM: Generative modeling, representation and in-context learning of biological and chemical sequences","Language models for biological and chemical sequences enable crucial applications such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine. Currently, these language models are predominantly based on Transformer architectures. While Transformers have yielded impressive results, their quadratic runtime dependency on sequence length complicates their use for long genomic sequences and in-context learning on proteins and chemical sequences. Recently, the recurrent xLSTM architecture has been shown to perform favorably compared to Transformers and modern state-space models (SSMs) in the natural language domain. Similar to SSMs, xLSTMs have linear runtime dependency and allow for constant-memory decoding at inference time, which makes them prime candidates for modeling long-range dependencies in biological and chemical sequences. In this work, we tailor xLSTM towards these domains and we propose a suite of language models called Bio-xLSTM. Extensive experiments in three large domains, genomics, proteins, and chemistry, were performed to assess xLSTM’s ability to model biological and chemical sequences. The results show that Bio-xLSTM is a highly proficient generative model for DNA, protein, and chemical sequences, learns rich representations, and can perform in-context learning for proteins and small molecules.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Rethinking Invariance in In-context Learning,"In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed \emph{Invariant ICL (InvICL)}, a methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two properties.

ICLR,2025,What is Wrong with Perplexity for Long-context Language Modeling?,"Handling long-context inputs is crucial for large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extended conversations, document summarization, and many-shot in-context learning. While recent approaches have extended the context windows of LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has proven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause of this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key tokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across all tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context scenarios. To address this, we propose \textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that focuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to identify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates with performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation of -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a re-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these contributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present effective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongPPL.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Attention with Markov: A Curious Case of Single-layer Transformers,"Attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. To deepen our understanding of their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on first-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently develop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram conditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to form an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a surprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the unigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the ground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model first-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel in practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior of single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a principled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our framework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local minima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture. We precisely delineate the regimes under which these local optima occur. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results.

ICLR,2025,Can In-context Learning Really Generalize to Out-of-distribution Tasks?,"In this work, we explore the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that were not encountered during training. To achieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn OOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that Transformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL. Specifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the pretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on the in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented ability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such ability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and, therefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore, we assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on multiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the existence of the \textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to implement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing context. We validate this through numerical experiments. This new theoretical result, combined with our empirical findings, elucidates the mechanism of ICL in addressing OOD tasks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Diffusion-based Neural Network Weights Generation,"Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, yet it remains constrained by challenges in model selection and the overhead of extensive model storage. In this work, we present Diffusion-based Neural Network Weights Generation, D2NWG, a novel framework that leverages diffusion processes to synthesize task-specific network weights. By modeling the distribution of weights from a diverse ensemble of pretrained models and conditioning the generation process on dataset characteristics, task descriptions, and architectural specifications, D2NWG circumvents the need for storing and searching through massive model repositories. We evaluate D2NWG across multiple experimental settings. On in-distribution tasks, our framework achieves performance that is on par with or superior to conventional pretrained models, while also serving as an effective initialization strategy for novel domains, resulting in faster convergence and a 6\% improvement in few-shot learning scenarios. Extensive ablation studies further indicate that our approach scales robustly with increased diversity and volume of pretrained models. Moreover, D2NWG demonstrates significant promise for large language model applications. In evaluations on the OpenLM leaderboard, our method improved LLaMA-3-2-1B-Instruct performance by 3\% on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, with a consistent gain of 0.36\% across a range of benchmarks.

ICLR,2025,Unsupervised Disentanglement of Content and Style via Variance-Invariance Constraints,"We contribute an unsupervised method that effectively learns disentangled content and style representations from sequences of observations. Unlike most disentanglement algorithms that rely on domain-specific labels or knowledge, our method is based on the insight of domain-general statistical differences between content and style --- content varies more among different fragments within a sample but maintains an invariant vocabulary across data samples, whereas style remains relatively invariant within a sample but exhibits more significant variation across different samples. We integrate such inductive bias into an encoder-decoder architecture and name our method after V3 (variance-versus-invariance). Experimental results show that V3 generalizes across multiple domains and modalities, successfully learning disentangled content and style representations, such as pitch and timbre from music audio, digit and color from images of hand-written digits, and action and character appearance from simple animations. V3 demonstrates strong disentanglement performance compared to existing unsupervised methods, along with superior out-of-distribution generalization and few-shot learning capabilities compared to supervised counterparts.

ICLR,2025,Decoupling Layout from Glyph in Online Chinese Handwriting Generation,"Text plays a crucial role in the transmission of human civilization, and teaching machines to generate online handwritten text in various styles presents an interesting and significant challenge. However, most prior work has concentrated on generating individual Chinese fonts, leaving complete text line generation largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify that text lines can naturally be divided into two components: layout and glyphs. Based on this division, we designed a text line layout generator coupled with a diffusion-based stylized font synthesizer to address this challenge hierarchically. More concretely, the layout generator performs in-context-like learning based on the text content and the provided style references to generate positions for each glyph autoregressively. Meanwhile, the font synthesizer which consists of a character embedding dictionary, a multi-scale calligraphy style encoder and a 1D U-Net based diffusion denoiser will generate each font on its position while imitating the calligraphy style extracted from the given style references. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the CASIA-OLHWDB demonstrate that our method is capable of generating structurally correct and indistinguishable imitation samples.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Manifold Induced Biases for Zero-shot and Few-shot Detection of Generated Images,"Distinguishing between real and AI-generated images, commonly referred to as  'image detection', presents a timely and significant challenge. Despite extensive research in the (semi-)supervised regime, zero-shot and few-shot solutions have only recently emerged as promising alternatives. Their main advantage is in alleviating the ongoing data maintenance, which quickly becomes outdated due to advances in generative technologies. We identify two main gaps: (1) a lack of theoretical grounding for the methods, and (2) significant room for performance improvements in zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our approach is founded on understanding and quantifying the biases inherent in generated content, where we use these quantities as criteria for characterizing generated images. Specifically, we explore the biases of the implicit probability manifold, captured by a pre-trained diffusion model. Through score-function analysis, we approximate the curvature, gradient, and bias towards points on the probability manifold, establishing criteria for detection in the zero-shot regime. We further extend our contribution to the few-shot setting by employing a mixture-of-experts methodology. Empirical results across 20 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. This work advances the theoretical understanding and practical usage of generated content biases through the lens of manifold analysis.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Training Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache,"The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.",⚡ 效率优化
ICLR,2025,Empowering LLM Agents with Zero-Shot Optimal Decision-Making through Q-learning,"Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive text data to gain general comprehension capability. Current LLM agents leverage this ability to make zero- or few-shot decisions without reinforcement learning (RL) but fail in making optimal decisions, as LLMs inherently perform next-token prediction rather than maximizing rewards. In contrast, agents trained via RL could make optimal decisions but require extensive environmental interaction. In this work, we develop an algorithm that combines the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs with the optimal decision-making of RL, referred to as the Model-based LLM Agent with Q-Learning (MLAQ). MLAQ employs Q-learning to derive optimal policies from transitions within memory. However, unlike RL agents that collect data from environmental interactions, MLAQ constructs an imagination space fully based on LLM to perform imaginary interactions for deriving zero-shot policies. Our proposed UCB variant generates high-quality imaginary data through interactions with the LLM-based world model, balancing exploration and exploitation while ensuring a sub-linear regret bound. Additionally, MLAQ incorporates a mixed-examination mechanism to filter out incorrect data. We evaluate MLAQ in benchmarks that present significant challenges for existing LLM agents. Results show that MLAQ achieves a optimal rate of over 90\% in tasks where other methods struggle to succeed. Additional experiments are conducted to reach the conclusion that introducing model-based RL into LLM agents shows significant potential to improve optimal decision-making ability.

ICLR,2025,Zeroth-Order Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Transferable Static Sparsity,"Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) is a memory-efficient strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models using only forward passes. However, applying ZO fine-tuning in memory-constrained settings such as mobile phones and laptops remains challenging since these settings often involve weight quantization, while ZO requires full-precision perturbation and update. In this study, we address this limitation by combining static sparse ZO fine-tuning with quantization. Our approach transfers a small, static subset (0.1%) of ""sensitive"" parameters from pre-training to downstream tasks, focusing fine-tuning on this sparse set of parameters. The remaining untuned parameters are quantized, reducing memory demands. Our proposed workflow enables efficient ZO fine-tuning of an Llama2-7B model on a GPU device with less than 8GB of memory while outperforming full model ZO fine-tuning performance and in-context learning.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Investigating the Pre-Training Dynamics of In-Context Learning: Task Recognition vs. Task Learning,"The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) is potentially attributed to two major abilities: task recognition (TR) for recognizing the task from demonstrations and utilizing pre-trained priors, and task learning (TL) for learning from demonstrations. However, relationships between the two abilities and how such relationships affect the emergence of ICL is unclear. In this paper, we take the first step by examining the pre-training dynamics of the emergence of ICL. With carefully designed metrics, we find that these two abilities are, in fact, competitive during pre-training. Moreover, we observe a negative correlation between the competition and the performance of ICL. Further analysis of common pre-training factors (i.e., model size, dataset size, and data curriculum) demonstrates possible ways to regulate the competition. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method to better integrate these two abilities for ICL at inference time. Through adaptive ensemble learning, the performance of ICL can be significantly boosted, enabling two small models to outperform a larger one with more than twice the parameters.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured LLM Inference,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation.This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through **KV-Guided Grouping**, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose **Flattened Tree KV Splitting**, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

ICLR,2025,Data-adaptive Differentially Private Prompt Synthesis for In-Context Learning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the contextual information embedded in examples/demonstrations to perform in-context learning (ICL). To mitigate the risk of LLMs potentially leaking private information contained in examples in the prompt, we introduce a novel data-adaptive differentially private algorithm called **AdaDPSyn** to generate synthetic examples from the private dataset and then use these synthetic examples to perform ICL. The objective of AdaDPSyn is to adaptively adjust the noise level in the data synthesis mechanism according to the inherent statistical properties of the data, thereby preserving high ICL accuracy while maintaining formal differential privacy guarantees. A key innovation in AdaDPSyn is the *Precision-Focused Iterative Radius Reduction* technique, which dynamically refines the aggregation radius - the scope of data grouping for noise addition - based on patterns observed in data clustering, thereby minimizing the amount of additive noise. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and compare AdaDPSyn with DP few-shot generation algorithm (Tang et al., 2023). The experiments demonstrate that AdaDPSyn not only outperforms DP few-shot generation, but also maintains high accuracy levels close to those of non-private baselines, providing an effective solution for ICL with privacy protection.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,Intermediate Layer Classifiers for OOD generalization,"Deep classifiers are known to be sensitive to data distribution shifts, primarily due to their reliance on spurious correlations in training data. It has been suggested that these classifiers can still find useful features in the network's last layer that hold up under such shifts. In this work, we question the use of last-layer representations for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and explore the utility of intermediate layers. To this end, we introduce \textit{Intermediate Layer Classifiers} (ILCs). We discover that intermediate layer representations frequently offer substantially better generalisation than those from the penultimate layer. In many cases, zero-shot OOD generalisation using earlier-layer representations approaches the few-shot performance of retraining on penultimate layer representations. This is confirmed across multiple datasets, architectures, and types of distribution shifts. Our analysis suggests that intermediate layers are less sensitive to distribution shifts compared to the penultimate layer. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how information is distributed across network layers and its role in OOD generalisation, while also pointing to the limits of penultimate layer representation utility.

ICLR,2025,Residual-MPPI: Online Policy Customization for Continuous Control,"Policies developed through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL) have shown great potential in continuous control tasks, but real-world applications often require adapting trained policies to unforeseen requirements. While fine-tuning can address such needs, it typically requires additional data and access to the original training metrics and parameters.
In contrast, an online planning algorithm, if capable of meeting the additional requirements, can eliminate the necessity for extensive training phases and customize the policy without knowledge of the original training scheme or task. In this work, we propose a generic online planning algorithm for customizing continuous-control policies at the execution time, which we call Residual-MPPI. It can customize a given prior policy on new performance metrics in few-shot and even zero-shot online settings, given access to the prior action distribution alone. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed Residual-MPPI algorithm can accomplish the few-shot/zero-shot online policy customization task effectively, including customizing the champion-level racing agent, Gran Turismo Sophy (GT Sophy) 1.0, in the challenging car racing scenario, Gran Turismo Sport (GTS) environment.

ICLR,2025,HARDMath: A Benchmark Dataset for Challenging Problems in Applied Mathematics,"Advanced applied mathematics problems are underrepresented in existing Large Language Model (LLM) benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{HARDMath}$, a dataset inspired by a graduate course on asymptotic methods, featuring challenging applied mathematics problems that require analytical approximation techniques. These problems demand a combination of mathematical reasoning, computational tools, and subjective judgment, making them difficult for LLMs. Our framework auto-generates a large number of problems with solutions validated against numerical ground truths. We evaluate both open- and closed-source LLMs on $\textbf{HARDMath-mini}$, a sub-sampled test set of 366 problems, as well as on 40 word problems formulated in applied science contexts. Even leading closed-source models like GPT-4 achieve only 43.8% overall accuracy with few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting, and all models demonstrate significantly lower performance compared to results on existing mathematics benchmark datasets. We additionally conduct a detailed error analysis to gain insights into the failure cases of LLMs. These results demonstrate the limitations of current LLM performance on advanced graduate-level applied math problems and underscore the importance of datasets like $\textbf{HARDMath}$ to advance mathematical abilities of LLMs.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,BenTo: Benchmark Reduction with In-Context Transferability,"Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is costly: it requires the generation and examination of LLM outputs on a large-scale benchmark of various tasks. This paper investigates how to efficiently reduce the tasks used to benchmark LLMs without affecting the evaluation quality. Our study reveals that task transferability and relevance provide critical information to identify the most representative subset of tasks via optimizing a facility location function. We propose a practically efficient metric for estimating the transferability between two tasks via in-context learning (ICL). By analyzing the pairwise transferability, we can reduce tasks in a modern LLM benchmark (e.g., MMLU or FLAN) to 5\% while inducing only a $<4$\% difference to the evaluation on the original benchmark.

ICLR,2025,NarrativeBridge: Enhancing Video Captioning with Causal-Temporal Narrative,"Existing video captioning benchmarks and models lack causal-temporal narrative, which is sequences of events linked through cause and effect, unfolding over time and driven by characters or agents. This lack of narrative restricts models’ ability to generate text descriptions that capture the causal and temporal dynamics inherent in video content. To address this gap, we propose NarrativeBridge, an approach comprising of: (1) a novel Causal-Temporal Narrative (CTN) captions benchmark generated using a large language model and few-shot prompting, explicitly encoding cause-effect temporal relationships in video descriptions; and (2) a Cause-Effect Network (CEN) with separate encoders for capturing cause and effect dynamics, enabling effective learning and generation of captions with causal-temporal narrative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in articulating the causal and temporal aspects of video content: 17.88 and 17.44 CIDEr on the MSVD-CTN and MSRVTT-CTN datasets, respectively. Cross-dataset evaluations further showcase CEN’s strong generalization capabilities. The proposed framework understands and generates nuanced text descriptions with intricate causal-temporal narrative structures present in videos, addressing a critical limitation in video captioning.

ICLR,2025,Dual Process Learning: Controlling Use of In-Context vs. In-Weights Strategies with Weight Forgetting,"Language models have the ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), allowing them to flexibly adapt their behavior based on context. This contrasts with in-weights learning (IWL), where memorized information is  encoded in model parameters after iterated observations of data. An ideal model should be able to flexibly deploy both of these abilities. Despite their apparent ability to learn in-context, language models are known to struggle when faced with unseen or rarely seen tokens  (Land & Bartolo, 2024). Hence, we study $\textbf{structural in-context learning}$, which we define as the ability of a model to execute in-context learning on arbitrary novel tokens -- so called because the model must generalize on the basis of e.g. sentence structure or task structure, rather than content encoded in token embeddings. We study structural in-context algorithms on both synthetic and naturalistic tasks using toy models, masked language models, and autoregressive language models. We find that structural ICL appears before quickly disappearing early in LM pretraining. While it has been shown that ICL can diminish during training (Singh et al., 2023), we find that prior work does not account for structural ICL. Building on Chen et al. (2024) 's active forgetting method, we introduce pretraining and finetuning methods that can modulate the preference for structural ICL and IWL. Importantly, this allows us to induce a $\textit{dual process strategy}$ where in-context and in-weights solutions coexist within a single model.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,GPS: A Probabilistic Distributional Similarity with Gumbel Priors for Set-to-Set Matching,"Set-to-set matching aims to identify correspondences between two sets of unordered items by minimizing a distance metric or maximizing a similarity measure. Traditional metrics, such as Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), are widely used for this purpose but often suffer from limitations like suboptimal performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, or high computational costs - or both. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective set-to-set matching similarity measure, GPS, based on Gumbel prior distributions. These distributions are typically used to model the extrema of samples drawn from various distributions. Our approach is motivated by the observation that the distributions of minimum distances from CD, as encountered in real world applications such as point cloud completion, can be accurately modeled using Gumbel distributions. We validate our method on tasks like few-shot image classification and 3D point cloud completion, demonstrating significant improvements over state of-the-art loss functions across several benchmark datasets.

ICLR,2025,Transformers Can Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning,"Traditionally, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn to solve new tasks by updating their neural network parameters through interactions with the task environment. However, recent works demonstrate that some RL agents, after certain pretraining procedures, can learn to solve unseen new tasks without parameter updates, a phenomenon known as in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). The empirical success of ICRL is widely attributed to the hypothesis that the forward pass of the pretrained agent neural network implements an RL algorithm. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by showing, both empirically and theoretically, that when a transformer is trained for policy evaluation tasks, it can discover and learn to implement temporal difference learning in its forward pass.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2025,Frequency-Guided Masking for Enhanced Vision Self-Supervised Learning,"We present a novel frequency-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach that significantly enhances its efficacy for pre-training. Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression,"We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression.

First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares (2SLS) solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the 2SLS method, in the presence of endogeneity.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,MotherNet: Fast Training and Inference via Hyper-Network Transformers,"Foundation models are transforming machine learning across many modalities, with in-context learning replacing classical model training. Recent work on tabular data hints at a similar opportunity to build foundation models for classification for numerical data. However, existing meta-learning approaches can not compete with tree-based methods in terms of inference time. In this paper, we propose MotherNet, a hypernetwork architecture trained on synthetic classification tasks that, once prompted with a never-seen-before training set generates the weights of a trained ``child'' neural-network by in-context learning using a single forward pass. In contrast to most existing hypernetworks that are usually trained for relatively constrained multi-task settings, MotherNet can create models for multiclass classification on arbitrary tabular datasets without any dataset specific gradient descent.
The child network generated by MotherNet outperforms neural networks trained using gradient descent on small datasets, and is competitive with predictions by TabPFN and standard ML methods like Gradient Boosting. Unlike a direct application of TabPFN, MotherNet generated networks are highly efficient at inference time.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Scaling Diffusion Language Models via Adaptation from Autoregressive Models,"Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts.

ICLR,2025,Efficient Exploration and Discriminative World Model Learning with an Object-Centric Abstraction,"In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.

We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to learn low level object-perturbing policies via reinforcement learning, and the object mapping itself by supervised learning.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Improving Large Language Model Planning with Action Sequence Similarity,"Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and proactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual and real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity.  Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.
Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline.

However, its development has been held back by the lack of challenging benchmarks, as all the experiments have been carried out in simple environments and on small-scale datasets. We present **XLand-100B**, a large-scale dataset for in-context reinforcement learning based on the XLand-MiniGrid environment, as a first step to alleviate this problem. It contains complete learning histories for nearly $30,000$ different tasks, covering $100$B transitions and $2.5$B episodes. It took $50,000$ GPU hours to collect the dataset, which is beyond the reach of most academic labs. Along with the dataset, we provide the utilities to reproduce or expand it even further.

ICLR,2025,Uncovering Overfitting in Large Language Model Editing,"Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are ineffective in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs’ knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn the Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,qNBO: quasi-Newton Meets Bilevel Optimization,"Bilevel optimization, which addresses challenges in hierarchical learning tasks, has gained significant interest in machine learning. Implementing gradient descent for bilevel optimization presents computational hurdles, notably the need to compute the exact lower-level solution and the inverse Hessian of the lower-level objective. While these two aspects are inherently connected, existing methods typically handle them separately by solving the lower-level problem and a linear system for the inverse Hessian-vector product. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to tackle these computational challenges in a coordinated manner. Specifically, we leverage quasi-Newton algorithms to accelerate the solution of the lower-level problem while efficiently approximating the inverse Hessian-vector product. Furthermore, by leveraging the superlinear convergence properties of BFGS, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the BFGS adaptation within our framework.

ICLR,2025,Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements,"The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a _one-size-fits-all_ approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with _static_ safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.

We propose _Controllable Safety Alignment_ (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow _safety configs_—free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors—that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a _human-authored_ benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts. We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment.

ICLR,2025,KBLaM: Knowledge Base augmented Language Model,"In this paper, we propose Knowledge Base augmented Language Model (KBLAM), a new method for augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. KBLAM works with a knowledge base (KB) constructed from a corpus of documents, transforming each piece of knowledge in the KB into continuous key-value vector pairs via pre-trained sentence encoders with linear adapters and
integrating them into pre-trained LLMs via a specialized rectangular attention mechanism. Unlike Retrieval-Augmented Generation, KBLAM eliminates external retrieval modules, and unlike in-context learning, its computational overhead scales linearly with KB size rather than quadratically. Our approach enables integrating a large KB of more than 10K triples into an 8B pre-trained LLM of only 8K context window on one single A100 80GB GPU and allows for dynamic updates without model fine-tuning or retraining.

Recent studies have shown that such data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities of large language models during multimodal fine-tuning. However, the limited scale and diversity of current image-text interleaved data restrict the development of multimodal large language models. In this paper, we introduce OmniCorpus, a 10 billion-scale image-text interleaved dataset. Using an efficient data engine, we filter and extract large-scale high-quality documents, which contain 8.6 billion images and 1,696 billion text tokens. Compared to counterparts (e.g., MMC4, OBELICS), our dataset 1) has 15 times larger scales while maintaining good data quality; 2) features more diverse sources, including both English and non-English websites as well as video-centric websites; 3) is more flexible, easily degradable from an image-text interleaved format to pure text corpus and image-text pairs.

ICLR,2025,Towards Auto-Regressive Next-Token Prediction: In-context Learning Emerges from Generalization,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities. However, existing theoretical analysis of ICL primarily exhibits two limitations: \textbf{(a) Limited \textit{i.i.d.} Setting.} Most studies focus on supervised function learning tasks where prompts are constructed with \textit{i.i.d.} input-label pairs. This \textit{i.i.d.} assumption diverges significantly from real language learning scenarios where prompt tokens are interdependent. \textbf{(b) Lack of Emergence Explanation.} Most literature answers \textbf{\textit{what}} ICL does from an implicit optimization perspective but falls short in elucidating \textbf{\textit{how}} ICL emerges and the impact of pre-training phase on ICL. In our paper, to extend (a), we adopt a more practical paradigm, \textbf{\textit{auto-regressive next-token prediction (AR-NTP)}}, which closely aligns with the actual training of language models. Specifically, within AR-NTP, we emphasize prompt token-dependency, which involves predicting each subsequent token based on the preceding sequence. To address (b), we formalize a systematic pre-training and ICL framework, highlighting the layer-wise structure of sequences and topics, alongside a two-level expectation. In conclusion, we present data-dependent, topic-dependent and optimization-dependent PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for pre-trained LLMs, investigating that \textbf{\textit{ICL emerges from the generalization of sequences and topics}}.

ICLR,2025,Towards Understanding the Universality of Transformers for Next-Token Prediction,"Causal Transformers are trained to predict the next token for a given context. While it is widely accepted that self-attention is crucial for encoding the causal structure of sequences, the precise underlying mechanism behind this in-context autoregressive learning ability remains unclear. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding this phenomenon by studying the approximation ability of Transformers for next-token prediction. Specifically, we explore the capacity of causal Transformers to predict the next token $x_{t+1}$ given an autoregressive sequence $(x_1, \dots, x_t)$ as a prompt, where $ x_{t+1} = f(x_t) $, and $ f $ is a context-dependent function that varies with each sequence.
On the theoretical side, we focus on specific instances, namely when $ f $ is linear or when $ (x_t)$ is periodic. We explicitly construct a Transformer (with linear, exponential, or softmax attention) that learns the mapping $f$ in-context through a causal kernel descent method. The causal kernel descent method we propose provably estimates $x_{t+1} $ based solely on past and current observations $ (x_1, \dots, x_t) $, with connections to the Kaczmarz algorithm in Hilbert spaces. We present experimental results that validate our theoretical findings and suggest their applicability to more general mappings $f$.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性

Recently, the advent of vision-language models (VLM) has heightened interest in enhancing OOD detection for VLM through few-shot tuning. However, existing methods mainly focus on optimizing global prompts, ignoring refined utilization of local information with regard to outliers. Motivated by this, we freeze global prompts and introduce Local-Prompt, a novel coarse-to-fine tuning paradigm to emphasize regional enhancement with local prompts. Our method comprises two integral components: global prompt guided negative augmentation and local prompt enhanced regional regularization. The former utilizes frozen, coarse global prompts as guiding cues to incorporate negative augmentation, thereby leveraging local outlier knowledge. The latter employs trainable local prompts and a regional regularization to capture local information effectively, aiding in outlier identification. We also propose regional-related metric to empower the enrichment of OOD detection. Moreover, since our approach explores enhancing local prompts only, it can be seamlessly integrated with trained global prompts during inference to boost the performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our method. Notably, our method reduces average FPR95 by 5.17% against state-of-the-art method in 4-shot tuning on challenging ImageNet-1k dataset, even outperforming 16-shot results of previous methods.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Don't Take Things Out of Context: Attention Intervention for Enhancing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), functioning as a whole to guide these models in generating reasoning steps toward final answers. However, we observe that isolated segments, words, or tokens within CoT demonstrations can unexpectedly disrupt the generation process of LLMs. The model may overly concentrate on certain local information present in the demonstration, introducing irrelevant noise into the reasoning process and potentially leading to incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanism of CoT through dynamically tracing and manipulating the inner workings of LLMs at each output step, which demonstrates that tokens exhibiting specific attention characteristics are more likely to induce the model to take things out of context; these tokens directly attend to the hidden states tied with prediction, without substantial integration of non-local information. Building upon these insights, we propose a Few-shot Attention Intervention method (FAI) that dynamically analyzes the attention patterns of demonstrations to accurately identify these tokens and subsequently make targeted adjustments to the attention weights to effectively suppress their distracting effect on LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, with a remarkable 5.91\% improvement on the AQuA dataset, further highlighting the effectiveness of FAI.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Multi-Perspective Data Augmentation for Few-shot Object Detection,"Recent few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods have focused on  augmenting synthetic samples for novel classes, show promising results  to the rise of diffusion models. However, the diversity of such datasets is often limited in representativeness because they lack awareness of typical and hard samples, especially in the context of foreground and background relationships. To tackle this issue, we propose a Multi-Perspective Data Augmentation (MPAD) framework. In terms of foreground-foreground relationships, we propose in-context learning for object synthesis (ICOS) with bounding box adjustments to enhance the detail and spatial information of synthetic samples. Inspired by the large margin principle, support samples play a vital role in defining class boundaries. Therefore, we design a Harmonic Prompt Aggregation Scheduler (HPAS) to mix prompt embeddings at each time step of the generation process in diffusion models, producing hard novel samples. For foreground-background relationships, we introduce a Background Proposal method (BAP) to sample typical and hard backgrounds. Extensive experiments on multiple FSOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving an average increase of $17.5\%$ in nAP50 over the baseline on PASCAL VOC.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors,"We study *behavioral self-awareness*, which we define as an LLM's capability to articulate its behavioral policies without relying on in-context examples. We finetune LLMs on examples that exhibit particular behaviors, including (a) making risk-seeking / risk-averse economic decisions, and (b) making the user say a certain word. Although these examples never contain explicit descriptions of the policy (e.g. ""I will now take the risk-seeking option""), we find that the finetuned LLMs can explicitly describe their policies through out-of-context reasoning. We demonstrate LLMs' behavioral self-awareness across various evaluation tasks, both for multiple-choice and free-form questions. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that models can correctly attribute different learned policies to distinct personas.
Finally, we explore the connection between behavioral self-awareness and the concept of backdoors in AI safety, where certain behaviors are implanted in a model, often through data poisoning, and can be triggered under certain conditions. We find evidence that LLMs can recognize the existence of the backdoor-like behavior that they have acquired through fine-tuning.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,Adaptive Transformer Programs: Bridging the Gap Between Performance and Interpretability in Transformers,"Balancing high performance with interpretability in increasingly powerful Transformer-based models remains a challenge. While mechanistic interpretability aims to specify neural network computations in explicit, pseudocode-like formats, existing methods often involve laborious manual analysis or struggle to fully elucidate learned internal algorithms. Recent efforts to build intrinsically interpretable models have introduced considerable expressivity and optimization challenges. This work introduces Adaptive Transformer Programs, an enhanced framework building upon RASP language and Transformer Programs to create more robust and interpretable models. The proposed method increases expressivity by redesigning two primary attention modules to improve categorical and numerical reasoning capabilities. To overcome optimization hurdles, we introduce a novel reparameterization scheme that enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including in-context learning, algorithmic problems (e.g., sorting and Dyck languages), and NLP benchmarks such as named entity recognition and text classification. Results demonstrate that Adaptive Transformer Programs substantially narrow the performance gap between black-box Transformers and interpretable models, enhancing transparency. This work advances the development of high-performing, transparent AI systems for critical applications, addressing crucial ethical concerns in AI development.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,RuAG: Learned-rule-augmented Generation for Large Language Models,"In-context learning (ICL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have gained attention for their ability to enhance LLMs' reasoning by incorporating external knowledge but suffer from limited contextual window size, leading to insufficient information injection. To this end, we propose a novel framework to automatically distill large volumes of offline data into interpretable first-order logic rules, which are injected into LLMs to boost their reasoning capabilities. Our method begins by formulating the search process relying on LLMs' commonsense, where LLMs automatically define head and body predicates. Then, we apply Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)  to address the combinational searching space and efficiently discover logic rules from data. The resulting logic rules are translated into natural language, allowing targeted knowledge injection and seamless integration into LLM prompts for LLM's downstream task reasoning. We evaluate our framework on public and private industrial tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), time-series, decision-making, and industrial tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM's capability over diverse tasks.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,A Solvable Attention for Neural Scaling Laws,"Transformers and many other deep learning models are empirically shown to predictably enhance their performance as a power law in training time, model size, or the number of training data points, which is termed as the neural scaling law. This paper studies this intriguing phenomenon particularly for the transformer architecture in theoretical setups. Specifically, we propose a framework for linear self-attention, the underpinning block of transformer without softmax, to learn in an in-context manner, where the corresponding learning dynamics is modeled as a non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Furthermore, we establish a procedure to derive a tractable approximate solution for this ODE system by reformulating it as a *Riccati equation*, which allows us to precisely characterize neural scaling laws for linear self-attention with training time, model size, data size, and the optimal compute. In addition, we reveal that the linear self-attention shares similar neural scaling laws with several other architectures when the context sequence length of the in-context learning is fixed, otherwise it would exhibit a different scaling law of training time.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,"Near, far: Patch-ordering enhances vision foundation models' scene understanding","We introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel self-supervised training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model. Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e. ""attract"" and ""repel"", this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches. Our method leverages differentiable sorting applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. This method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establishes several new state-of-the-art results such as +2.3 % and +4.2% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, +1.6% and +4.8% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff and improvements in the 3D understanding of multi-view consistency on SPair-71k, by more than 1.5%.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,Cross-Domain Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for Contextual Bandits,"Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning (OPE/L) in contextual bandits is rapidly gaining popularity in real systems because new policies can be evaluated and learned securely using only historical logged data. However, existing methods in OPE/L cannot handle many challenging but prevalent scenarios such as few-shot data, deterministic logging policies, and new actions. In many applications, such as personalized medicine, content recommendations, education, and advertising, we need to evaluate and learn new policies in the presence of these challenges. Existing methods cannot evaluate and optimize effectively in these situations due to the notorious variance issue or limited exploration in the logged data. To enable OPE/L even under these unsolved challenges, we propose a new problem setup of Cross-Domain OPE/L, where we have access not only to the logged data from the target domain in which the new policy will be implemented but also to logged datasets collected from other domains. This novel formulation is widely applicable because we can often use historical data not only from the target hospital, country, device, or user segment but also from other hospitals, countries, devices, or segments. We develop a new estimator and policy gradient method to solve OPE/L by leveraging both target and source datasets, resulting in substantially enhanced OPE/L in the previously unsolved situations in our empirical evaluations.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,Toward Exploratory Inverse Constraint Inference with Generative Diffusion Verifiers,"An important prerequisite for safe control is aligning the policy with the underlying constraints in the environment. In many real-world applications, due to the difficulty of manually specifying these constraints, existing works have proposed recovering constraints from expert demonstrations by solving the Inverse Constraint Learning (ICL) problem. However, ICL is inherently ill-posed, as multiple constraints can equivalently explain the experts' preferences, making the optimal solutions not uniquely identifiable. In this work, instead of focusing solely on a single constraint, we propose the novel approach of Exploratory ICL (ExICL). The goal of ExICL is to recover a diverse set of feasible constraints, thereby providing practitioners the flexibility to select the most appropriate constraint based on the practical needs of deployment. To achieve this goal, we design a generative diffusion verifier that guides the trajectory generation process using the probabilistic representation of an optimal constrained policy. By comparing these decisions with those made by expert agents, we can efficiently verify a candidate constraint. Driven by the verification feedback, ExICL implements an exploratory constraint update mechanism that strategically facilitates diversity within the collection of feasible constraints. Our empirical results demonstrate that ExICL can seamlessly and reliably generalize across different tasks and environments.

ICLR,2025,Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: (1) LLMs understand time series better as *images* rather than as text, (2) LLMs do not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in *explicit reasoning* about time series analysis. (3) Contrary to common beliefs, LLMs' understanding of time series *do not* stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities. (4) LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis *vary significantly* across different models. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand trivial time series anomalies (we have no evidence that they can understand more subtle real-world anomalies), many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold.

ICLR,2025,Planning Anything with Rigor: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Planning with LLM-based Formalized Programming,"While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7\% and 86.8\% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6\% and 40.7\% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2025,Is Factuality Enhancement a Free Lunch For LLMs? Better Factuality Can Lead to Worse Context-Faithfulness,"As the modern tools of choice for text understanding and generation, large language models (LLMs) are expected to accurately output answers by leveraging the input context.
This requires LLMs to possess both context-faithfulness and factual accuracy.
While extensive efforts aim to reduce hallucinations through factuality enhancement methods, they also pose risks of hindering context-faithfulness, as factuality enhancement can lead LLMs to become overly confident in their parametric knowledge, causing them to overlook the relevant input context.
In this work, we argue that current factuality enhancement methods can significantly undermine the context-faithfulness of LLMs.
We first revisit the current factuality enhancement methods and evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing factual accuracy.
Next, we evaluate their performance on knowledge editing tasks to assess the potential impact on context-faithfulness.
The experimental results reveal that while these methods may yield inconsistent improvements in factual accuracy, they also cause a more severe decline in context-faithfulness, with the largest decrease reaching a striking 69.7\%.
To explain these declines, we analyze the hidden states and logit distributions for the tokens representing new knowledge and parametric knowledge respectively, highlighting the limitations of current approaches.
Our finding highlights the complex trade-offs inherent in enhancing LLMs.
Therefore, we recommend that more research on LLMs' factuality enhancement make efforts to reduce the sacrifice of context-faithfulness.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,Tree of Attributes Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models,"Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a “concept - attribute - description” structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets.

ICLR,2025,ROUTE: Robust Multitask Tuning and Collaboration for Text-to-SQL,"Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. 
To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution.  Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation.  Unlike existing SFT-based  Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing.  Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy.  This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

We present a comprehensive analysis for “in-context” conditional DiTs under various common assumptions: generic and strong Hölder, linear latent (subspace), and Lipschitz score function assumptions. Importantly, we establish minimax optimality of DiTs by leveraging score function regularity. Specifically, we discretize the input domains into infinitesimal grids and then perform term-by-term Taylor expansions on the conditional diffusion score function under the Hölder smooth data assumption. This enables fine-grained use of transformers’ universal approximation through a more detailed piecewise constant approximation, and hence obtains tighter bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to latent settings. Our findings establish statistical limits for DiTs and offer practical guidance toward more efficient and accurate designs.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Task Descriptors Help Transformers Learn Linear Models In-Context,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong in-context learning (ICL) ability, which allows the model to make predictions on new examples based on the given prompt. Recently, a line of research (Von Oswald et al., 2023; Aky¨urek et al., 2023; Ahn et al., 2023; Mahankali et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) considered ICL for a simple linear regression setting and showed that the forward pass of Transformers is simulating some variants of gradient descent (GD) algorithms on the in-context examples. In practice, the input prompt usually contains a task descriptor in addition to in-context examples. We investigate how the task description helps ICL in the linear regression setting. Consider a simple setting where the task descriptor describes the mean of input in linear regression. Our results show that gradient flow converges to a global minimum for a linear Transformer. At the global minimum, the Transformer learns to use the task descriptor effectively to improve its performance. Empirically, we verify our results by showing that the weights converge to the predicted global minimum and Transformers indeed perform better with task descriptors.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Learning General-purpose Biomedical Volume Representations using Randomized Synthesis,"Current volumetric biomedical foundation models struggle to generalize as public 3D datasets are small and do not cover the broad diversity of medical procedures, conditions, anatomical regions, and imaging protocols. We address this by creating a representation learning method that instead anticipates strong domain shifts at training time itself. We first propose a data engine that synthesizes highly variable training samples that would enable generalization to new biomedical contexts. To then train a single 3D network for any voxel-level task, we develop a contrastive learning method that pretrains the network to be stable against nuisance imaging variation simulated by the data engine, a key inductive bias for generalization. This network's features can be used as robust representations of input images for downstream tasks and its weights provide a strong, _dataset-agnostic_ initialization for finetuning on new datasets. As a result, we set new standards across _both_ multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation, a first for any 3D biomedical vision model, all without (pre-)training on any existing dataset of real images.",🎯 特定技术方法

Despite the empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how to train a Transformer to achieve the CoT ability remains less explored. This is primarily due to the technical challenges involved in analyzing the nonconvex optimization on nonlinear attention models. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first theoretical study of training Transformers with nonlinear attention to obtain the CoT generalization capability so that the resulting model can inference on unseen tasks when the input is augmented by examples of the new task. We first quantify the required training samples and iterations to train a Transformer model towards CoT ability.  We then prove the success of its CoT generalization on unseen tasks with distribution-shifted testing data. Moreover, we theoretically characterize the conditions for an accurate reasoning output by CoT even when the provided reasoning examples contain noises and are not always accurate. In contrast, in-context learning (ICL), which can be viewed as one-step CoT without intermediate steps, may fail to provide an accurate output when CoT does.

In this paper, we study this distinction empirically and theoretically in a controlled synthetic setting where certain next-token predictions involve both distributional and in-context information. We find that feed-forward layers tend to learn simple distributional associations such as bigrams, while attention layers focus on in-context reasoning.

ICLR,2025,InstructRAG: Instructing Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Self-Synthesized Rationales,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising potential to enhance the accuracy and factuality of language models (LMs). However, imperfect retrievers or noisy corpora can introduce misleading or even erroneous information to the retrieved contents, posing a significant challenge to the generation quality. Existing RAG methods typically address this challenge by directly predicting final answers despite potentially noisy inputs, resulting in an implicit denoising process that is difficult to interpret and verify. On the other hand, the acquisition of explicit denoising supervision is often costly, involving significant human efforts. In this work, we propose InstructRAG, where LMs explicitly learn the denoising process through self-synthesized rationales --- First, we instruct the LM to explain how the ground-truth answer is derived from retrieved documents. Then, these rationales can be used either as demonstrations for in-context learning of explicit denoising or as supervised fine-tuning data to train the model. Compared to standard RAG approaches, InstructRAG requires no additional supervision, allows for easier verification of the predicted answers, and effectively improves generation accuracy. Experiments show InstructRAG consistently outperforms existing RAG methods in both training-free and trainable scenarios, achieving a relative improvement of 8.3% over the best baseline method on average across five knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Extensive analysis indicates that InstructRAG scales well with increased numbers of retrieved documents and consistently exhibits robust denoising ability even in out-of-domain datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,Implicit In-context Learning,"In-context Learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to swiftly adapt to unseen tasks at inference-time by prefixing a few demonstration examples before queries. Despite its versatility, ICL incurs substantial computational and memory overheads compared to zero-shot learning and is sensitive to the selection and order of demonstration examples. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Implicit In-context Learning} (I2CL), an innovative paradigm that reduces the inference cost of ICL to that of zero-shot learning with minimal information loss. I2CL operates by first generating a condensed vector representation, namely a context vector, extracted from the demonstration examples. It then conducts an inference-time intervention through injecting a linear combination of the context vector and query activations back into the model’s residual streams. Empirical evaluation on nine real-world tasks across three model architectures demonstrates that I2CL achieves few-shot level performance at zero-shot inference cost, and it exhibits robustness against variations in demonstration examples. Furthermore, I2CL facilitates a novel representation of ``task-ids'', enhancing task similarity detection and fostering effective transfer learning.

We propose two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes.

ICLR,2025,Dist Loss: Enhancing Regression in Few-Shot Region through Distribution Distance Constraint,"Imbalanced data distributions are prevalent in real-world scenarios, presenting significant challenges in both classification and regression tasks. This imbalance often causes deep learning models to overfit in regions with abundant data (manyshot regions) while underperforming in regions with sparse data (few-shot regions). Such characteristics limit the applicability of deep learning models across various domains, notably in healthcare, where rare cases often carry greater clinical significance. While recent studies have highlighted the benefits of incorporating distributional information in imbalanced classification tasks, similar strategies have been largely unexplored in imbalanced regression. To address this gap, we propose Dist Loss, a novel loss function that integrates distributional information into model training by jointly optimizing the distribution distance between model predictions and target labels, alongside sample-wise prediction errors. This dual-objective approach encourages the model to balance its predictions across different label regions, leading to significant improvements in accuracy in fewshot regions. We conduct extensive experiments across three datasets spanning computer vision and healthcare: IMDB-WIKI-DIR, AgeDB-DIR, and ECG-KDIR.

However, as LLMs' in-context learning abilities continue to improve, understanding this phenomenon mechanistically becomes increasingly important. In particular, it is not well-understood how LLMs learn to solve specific classes of problems, such as reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in-context. Through three different tasks, we first show that Llama $3$ $70$B can solve simple RL problems in-context. We then analyze the residual stream of Llama using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and find representations that closely match temporal difference (TD) errors. Notably, these representations emerge despite the model only being trained to predict the next token. We verify that these representations are indeed causally involved in the computation of TD errors and $Q$-values by performing carefully designed interventions on them. Taken together, our work establishes a methodology for studying and manipulating in-context learning with SAEs, paving the way for a more mechanistic understanding.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,Can Generative AI Solve Your In-Context Learning Problem?  A Martingale Perspective,"This work is about estimating when a conditional generative model (CGM) can solve an in-context learning (ICL) problem. An in-context learning (ICL) problem comprises a CGM, a dataset, and a prediction task. The CGM could be a multi-modal foundation model; the dataset, a collection of patient histories, test results, and recorded diagnoses; and the prediction task to communicate a diagnosis to a new patient. A Bayesian interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes a posterior predictive distribution over an unknown Bayesian model defining a joint distribution over latent explanations and observable data. From this perspective, Bayesian model criticism is a reasonable approach to assess the suitability of a given CGM for an ICL problem. However, such approaches---like posterior predictive checks (PPCs)---often assume that we can sample from the likelihood and posterior defined by the Bayesian model, which are not explicitly given for contemporary CGMs. To address this, we show when ancestral sampling from the predictive distribution of a CGM is equivalent to sampling datasets from the posterior predictive of the assumed Bayesian model. Then we develop the generative predictive $p$-value, which enables PPCs and their cousins for contemporary CGMs. The generative predictive $p$-value can be used in a statistical decision procedure to determine when the model is appropriate for an ICL problem. Our method only requires generating queries and responses from a CGM and evaluating its response log probability. Using large language models, we empirically evaluate our method on tasks involving tabular data, imaging data, and natural language data.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,WeatherGFM: Learning a Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning,"The Earth's weather system involves intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. 
Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). 
While these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. 
Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound.
Inspired by the in-context learning paradigm from visual foundation models and large language models, in this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather generalist foundation model (WeatherGFM) to address weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. 
Specifically, we first unify the representation and definition for diverse weather understanding tasks.
Subsequently, we design weather prompt formats to handle different weather data modalities, including single, multiple, and temporal modalities. 
Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. 
Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to 12 weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/xiangyu-mm/WeatherGFM.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Unsupervised Meta-Learning via In-Context Learning,"Unsupervised meta-learning aims to learn feature representations from unsupervised datasets that can transfer to downstream tasks with limited labeled data.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised meta-learning that leverages the generalization abilities of in-context learning observed in transformer architectures. Our method reframes meta-learning as a sequence modeling problem, enabling the transformer encoder to learn task context from support images and utilize it to predict query images. 
At the core of our approach lies the creation of diverse tasks generated using a combination of data augmentations and a mixing strategy that challenges the model during training while fostering generalization to unseen tasks at test time. 
Experimental results on benchmark datasets showcase the superiority of our approach over existing unsupervised meta-learning baselines, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art. Remarkably, our method achieves competitive results with supervised and self-supervised approaches, underscoring its efficacy in leveraging generalization over memorization.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Multimodality Helps Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation (FS-PCS) aims at generalizing models to segment novel categories with minimal annotated support samples. While existing FS-PCS methods have shown promise, they primarily focus on unimodal point cloud inputs, overlooking the potential benefits of leveraging multimodal information. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal FS-PCS setup, utilizing textual labels and the potentially available 2D image modality. Under this easy-to-achieve setup, we present the MultiModal Few-Shot SegNet (MM-FSS), a model effectively harnessing complementary information from multiple modalities. MM-FSS employs a shared backbone with two heads to extract intermodal and unimodal visual features, and a pretrained text encoder to generate text embeddings. To fully exploit the multimodal information, we propose a Multimodal Correlation Fusion (MCF) module to generate multimodal correlations, and a Multimodal Semantic Fusion (MSF) module to refine the correlations using text-aware semantic guidance. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Test-time Adaptive Cross-modal Calibration (TACC) technique to mitigate training bias, further improving generalization. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by our method. The efficacy of our approach indicates the benefits of leveraging commonly-ignored free modalities for FS-PCS, providing valuable insights for future research.

ICLR,2025,Chain-of-Thought Provably Enables Learning the (Otherwise) Unlearnable,"Modern language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities by using chain-of-thought (CoT). One hypothesis about the inner workings of CoT is that it breaks down originally complex tasks into smaller subtasks that are more amenable to learning. We formalize this notion by showing possibility and impossibility results of learning from in-context demonstrations with and without CoT. In particular, with CoT, we examine a family of learning algorithms that learn a task step-by-step, capable of composing simpler functions from individual reasoning steps to form an overall complex function. This process reduces the difficulty of learning a task to that of the hardest reasoning step in the chain. Moreover, we prove Transformers can express this algorithm and thus they can efficiently in-context learn arbitrary tasks as long as these tasks can be decomposed into a finite number of subtasks, each of which are efficiently learnable. In contrast, without CoT, we demonstrate that there exist tasks that are inherently unlearnable by the same algorithm. Overall, our results suggest several provably effective ways for decomposing target problems to instantiate CoT. Empirically, we demonstrate our proposed CoT construction significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of real-world LLMs in solving challenging arithmetic reasoning tasks, including learning polynomials and Boolean formulas.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Beyond Interpretability: The Gains of Feature Monosemanticity on Model Robustness,"Deep learning models often suffer from a lack of interpretability due to \emph{polysemanticity}, where individual neurons are activated by multiple unrelated semantics, resulting in unclear attributions of model behavior. Recent advances in \emph{monosemanticity}, where neurons correspond to consistent and distinct semantics, have significantly improved interpretability but are commonly believed to compromise accuracy. In this work, we challenge the prevailing belief of the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff, showing that monosemantic features not only enhance interpretability but also bring concrete gains in model performance of {\color{black} robustness-related tasks}. Across multiple robust learning scenarios—including input and label noise, few-shot learning, and out-of-domain generalization—our results show that models leveraging monosemantic features significantly outperform those relying on polysemantic features. Furthermore, we provide empirical and theoretical understandings on the robustness gains of feature monosemanticity. Our preliminary analysis suggests that monosemanticity, by promoting better separation of feature representations, leads to more robust decision boundaries {\color{black} under noise}. This diverse evidence highlights the \textbf{generality} of monosemanticity in improving model robustness. As a first step in this new direction, we embark on exploring the learning benefits of monosemanticity beyond interpretability, supporting the long-standing hypothesis of linking interpretability and robustness.

ICLR,2025,Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent with Chain of Thought,"Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in arithmetic and reasoning tasks, by instructing the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the remarkable empirical success of CoT and its theoretical advantages in enhancing expressivity, the mechanisms underlying CoT training remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the training dynamics of transformers over a CoT objective on a in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. We prove that while a one-layer linear transformer without CoT can only implement a single step of gradient descent (GD) and fails to recover the ground-truth weight vector, a transformer with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step GD autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery. Furthermore, we show that the trained transformer effectively generalizes on the unseen data. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoT prompting yields substantial performance improvements.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,CURIE: Evaluating LLMs on Multitask Scientific Long-Context Understanding and Reasoning,"Scientific problem-solving involves synthesizing information while applying expert  knowledge.   We  introduce  CURIE,  a  scientific  long-Context  Understanding, Reasoning, and Information Extraction benchmark to measure the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific problem-solving and assisting scientists in realistic workflows. This benchmark introduces ten challenging tasks with a total of 580 problems and solution pairs curated by experts in six disciplines - materials science, condensed matter physics, quantum computing, geo-spatial analysis, biodiversity, and proteins - covering both experimental and theoretical work-flows in science. We evaluate a range of closed and open LLMs on tasks in CURIE which requires domain expertise, comprehension of long in-context information,and multi-step reasoning.  While Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude-3 show consistent high comprehension across domains, the popular GPT-4o and command-R+ fail dramatically on protein sequencing tasks. With the best performance at 32% there is much room for improvement for all models. We hope that insights gained from CURIE can guide the future development of LLMs in sciences.

ICLR,2025,Predicate Hierarchies Improve Few-Shot State Classification,"State classification of objects and their relations is core to many long-horizon tasks, particularly in robot planning and manipulation. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible object-predicate combinations, coupled with the need to adapt to novel real-world environments, makes it a desideratum for state classification models to generalize to novel queries with few examples. To this end, we propose PHIER, which leverages predicate hierarchies to generalize effectively in few-shot scenarios. PHIER uses an object-centric scene encoder, self-supervised losses that infer semantic relations between predicates, and a hyperbolic distance metric that captures hierarchical structure; it learns a structured latent space of image-predicate pairs that guides reasoning over state classification queries. We evaluate PHIER in the CALVIN and BEHAVIOR robotic environments and show that PHIER significantly outperforms existing methods in few-shot, out-of-distribution state classification, and demonstrates strong zero- and few-shot generalization from simulated to real-world tasks. Our results demonstrate that leveraging predicate hierarchies improves performance on state classification tasks with limited data.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Metalic: Meta-Learning In-Context with Protein Language Models,"Predicting the biophysical and functional properties of proteins is essential for in silico protein design. Machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for such prediction tasks. However, the relative scarcity of in vitro annotations means that these models often have little, or no, specific data on the desired fitness prediction task. As a result of limited data, protein language models (PLMs) are typically trained on general protein sequence modeling tasks, and then fine-tuned, or applied zero-shot, to protein fitness prediction. When no task data is available, the models make strong assumptions about the correlation between the protein sequence likelihood and fitness scores. In contrast, we propose meta-learning over a distribution of standard fitness prediction tasks, and demonstrate positive transfer to unseen fitness prediction tasks. Our method, called Metalic (Meta-Learning In-Context), uses in-context learning and fine-tuning, when data is available, to adapt to new tasks. Crucially, fine-tuning enables considerable generalization, even though it is not accounted for during meta-training. Our fine-tuned models achieve strong results with 18 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our method sets a new state-of-the-art in low-data settings on ProteinGym, an established fitness-prediction benchmark. Due to data scarcity, we believe meta-learning will play a pivotal role in advancing protein engineering.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Block-Attention for Efficient Prefilling,"We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. 
Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner.
Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block.
In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference.
The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. 
Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss.
Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICLR,2025,Selective Induction Heads: How Transformers Select Causal Structures in Context,"Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modelling tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel synthetic framework designed to enable the theoretical analysis of transformers’ ability to dynamically handle causal structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context.  To this end, our framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure in-context. We empirically demonstrate that attention-only transformers learn this mechanism to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a 3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding of how transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their functioning and interpretability.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Transformers are Universal In-context Learners,"Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context mappings'' which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In this work, we study in particular the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly address their expressivity, we consider the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution of tokens which becomes discrete for a finite number of these. The relevant notion of smoothness then corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance between these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. This result implies, as a special case, that transformers are universal approximators for continuous permutation-invariant mappings over a fixed number of tokens. It also establishes the universal approximation capability of transformers for certain in-context learning tasks, demonstrating in particular their ability to perform regression within context. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLPs between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled. We consider both unmasked attentions (as used for the vision transformer) and masked causal attentions (as used for NLP and time series applications). We tackle the causal setting leveraging a space-time lifting to analyze causal attention as a mapping over probability distributions of tokens.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2025,Autoregressive Video Generation without Vector Quantization,"This paper presents a novel approach that enables autoregressive video generation with high efficiency. We propose to reformulate the video generation problem as a non-quantized autoregressive modeling of temporal frame-by-frame prediction and spatial set-by-set prediction. Unlike raster-scan prediction in prior autoregressive models or joint distribution modeling of fixed-length tokens in diffusion models, our approach maintains the causal property of GPT-style models for flexible in-context capabilities, while leveraging bidirectional modeling within individual frames for efficiency. With the proposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector quantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior autoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual fidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e., 0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost. Additionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables diverse zero-shot applications in one unified model.

ICLR,2025,Are Transformers Able to Reason by Connecting Separated Knowledge in Training Data?,"Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence.  In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, ""FTCT"" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of  Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. During training, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. In testing, Transformers must combine these fragments to infer complete causal traces. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Differential Transformer,"Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture for large language models.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2025,Context-Alignment: Activating and Enhancing LLMs Capabilities in Time Series,"Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment, but overlook LLMs' inherent strength in natural language processing — their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment (CA), a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs to treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Following the DSCA-GNNs framework, we propose an instantiation method of CA, termed Few-Shot prompting Context-Alignment (FSCA), to enhance the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in handling TS tasks. FSCA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of FSCA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provides powerful prior knowledge on context.

ICLR,2025,Prototype antithesis for biological few-shot class-incremental learning,"Deep learning has become essential in the biological species recognition task. However, a significant challenge is the ability to continuously learn new or mutated species with limited annotated samples. Since species within the same family typically share similar traits, distinguishing between new and existing (old) species during incremental learning often faces the issue of species confusion. This can result in ""catastrophic forgetting"" of old species and poor learning of new ones. To address this issue, we propose a Prototype Antithesis (PA) method, which leverages the hierarchical structures in biological taxa to reduce confusion between new and old species. PA operates in two steps: Residual Prototype Learning (RPL) and Residual Prototype Mixing (RPM). RPL enables the model to learn unique prototypes for each species alongside residual prototypes representing shared traits within families. RPM generates synthetic samples by blending features of new species with residual prototypes of old species, encouraging the model to focus on species-unique traits and minimize species confusion. By integrating RPL and RPM, the proposed PA method mitigates ""catastrophic forgetting"" while improving generalization to new species. Extensive experiments on CUB200, PlantVillage, and Tree-of-Life datasets demonstrate that PA significantly reduces inter-species confusion and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its potential for deep learning in biological data analysis.",🎯 特定技术方法

Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into multimodal ICL have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL.

In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, multimodal in-context examples, and lengthy videos.

ICLR,2025,Black Sheep in the Herd: Playing with Spuriously Correlated Attributes for Vision-Language Recognition,"Few-shot adaptation for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) presents a dilemma: balancing in-distribution accuracy with out-of-distribution generalization. Recent research has utilized low-level concepts such as visual attributes to enhance generalization. However, this study reveals that VLMs overly rely on a small subset of attributes on decision-making, which co-occur with the category but are not inherently part of it, termed spuriously correlated attributes. This biased nature of VLMs results in poor generalization. To address this, 1) we first propose Spurious Attribute Probing (SAP), identifying and filtering out these problematic attributes to significantly enhance the generalization of existing attribute-based methods; 2) We introduce Spurious Attribute Shielding (SAS), a plug-and-play module that mitigates the influence of these attributes on prediction, seamlessly integrating into various Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods. In experiments, SAP and SAS significantly enhance accuracy on distribution shifts across 11 datasets and 3 generalization tasks without compromising downstream performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Is In-Context Learning Sufficient for Instruction Following in LLMs?,"In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights: this is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples. Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on established benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0 (LC), especially with more capable base LLMs. We then uncover the most relevant elements for successful in-context alignment, finding the crucial role of the decoding parameters. Based on these insights, we show that the approach of URIAL can indeed be improved by adding more, potentially carefully selected, high-quality demonstrations in context, getting closer to the performance of instruct models. Finally, we provide the first, to our knowledge, systematic comparison of ICL and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) for instruction following in the low data regime. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique and its relationship to IFT.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2025,Distilling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for In-Context Model-Based Planning,"Recent studies have shown that Transformers can perform in-context reinforcement learning (RL) by imitating existing RL algorithms, enabling sample-efficient adaptation to unseen tasks without parameter updates. However, these models also inherit the suboptimal behaviors of the RL algorithms they imitate. This issue primarily arises due to the gradual update rule employed by those algorithms. Model-based planning offers a promising solution to this limitation by allowing the models to simulate potential outcomes before taking action, providing an additional mechanism to deviate from the suboptimal behavior. Rather than learning a separate dynamics model, we propose Distillation for In-Context Planning (DICP), an in-context model-based RL framework where Transformers simultaneously learn environment dynamics and improve policy in-context. We evaluate DICP across a range of discrete and continuous environments, including Darkroom variants and Meta-World.

ICLR,2025,Chain-of-Focus Prompting: Leveraging Sequential Visual Cues to Prompt Large Autoregressive Vision Models,"In-context learning (ICL) has revolutionized natural language processing by enabling models to adapt to diverse tasks with only a few illustrative examples. However, the exploration of ICL within the field of computer vision remains limited. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in the language domain, we propose Chain-of-Focus (CoF) Prompting, which enhances vision models by enabling step-by-step visual comprehension. CoF Prompting addresses the challenges of absent logical structure in visual data by generating intermediate reasoning steps through visual saliency. Moreover, it provides a solution for creating tailored prompts from visual inputs by selecting contextually informative prompts based on query similarity and target richness. The significance of CoF prompting is demonstrated by the recent introduction of Large Autoregressive Vision Models (LAVMs), which predict downstream targets via in-context learning with pure visual inputs. By integrating intermediate reasoning steps into visual prompts and effectively selecting the informative ones, the LAVMs are capable of generating significantly better inferences. Extensive experiments on downstream visual understanding tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method for visual in-context learning.",🧠 推理与思维链

However, existing methods typically assume a homogeneous preference shared by all individuals, overlooking the diversity inherent in human values.

As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024$\times$1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.

ICLR,2025,Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks,"We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple *adaptive* jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to *logprobs* for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token *``Sure''*), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100\% attack success rate---according to GPT-4 as a judge---on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak *all* Claude models---that do not expose logprobs---via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a *100\% success rate*. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models---a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking---which is the algorithm that brought us the *first place* in a recent trojan detection competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that *adaptivity* is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICLR,2025,Understanding the Generalization of In-Context Learning in Transformers: An Empirical Study,"Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 utilize the powerful in-context learning (ICL) capability of Transformer architecture to learn on the fly from limited examples. While ICL underpins many LLM applications, its full potential remains hindered by a limited understanding of its generalization boundaries and vulnerabilities. We present a systematic investigation of transformers' generalization capability with ICL relative to training data coverage by defining a task-centric framework along three dimensions: inter-problem, intra-problem, and intra-task generalization. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, encompassing tasks such as function fitting, API calling, and translation, we find that transformers lack inter-problem generalization with ICL, but excel in intra-task and intra-problem generalization. When the training data includes a greater variety of mixed tasks, it significantly enhances the generalization ability of ICL on unseen tasks and even on known simple tasks. This guides us in designing training data to maximize the diversity of tasks covered and to combine different tasks whenever possible, rather than solely focusing on the target task for testing.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICLR,2025,Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems,"Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors.
We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,MLPs Learn In-Context on Regression and Classification Tasks,"In-context learning (ICL), the remarkable ability to solve a task from only input exemplars, is often assumed to be a unique hallmark of Transformer models. By examining commonly employed synthetic ICL tasks, we demonstrate that multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can also learn in-context. Moreover, MLPs, and the closely related MLP-Mixer models, learn in-context comparably with Transformers under the same compute budget in this setting. We further show that MLPs outperform Transformers on a series of classical tasks from psychology designed to test relational reasoning, which are closely related to in-context classification. These results underscore a need for studying in-context learning beyond attention-based architectures, while also challenging prior arguments against MLPs' ability to solve relational tasks. Altogether, our results highlight the unexpected competence of MLPs in a synthetic setting, and support the growing interest in all-MLP alternatives to Transformer architectures. It remains unclear how MLPs perform against Transformers at scale on real-world tasks, and where a performance gap may originate. We encourage further exploration of these architectures in more complex settings to better understand the potential comparative advantage of attention-based schemes.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICLR,2025,Efficient and Context-Aware Label Propagation for Zero-/Few-Shot Training-Free Adaptation of Vision-Language Model,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have revolutionized machine learning by leveraging large pre-trained models to tackle various downstream tasks. Although label, training, and data efficiency have improved, many state-of-the-art VLMs still require task-specific hyperparameter tuning and fail to fully exploit test samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a graph-based approach for label-efficient adaptation and inference. Our method dynamically constructs a graph over text prompts, few-shot examples, and test samples, using label propagation for inference without task-specific tuning. Unlike existing zero-shot label propagation techniques, our approach requires no additional unlabeled support set and effectively leverages the test sample manifold through dynamic graph expansion. We further introduce a context-aware feature re-weighting mechanism to improve task adaptation accuracy. Additionally, our method supports efficient graph expansion, enabling real-time inductive inference. Extensive evaluations on downstream tasks, such as fine-grained categorization and out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

ICLR,2025,Vector-ICL: In-context Learning with Continuous Vector Representations,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities on textual data. We explore whether these capabilities can be extended to continuous vectors from diverse domains, obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. By aligning input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors, we observe that LLMs can effectively process and learn from these projected vectors, which we term Vector-ICL. In particular, we find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. In our experiments across various tasks and modalities, including text reconstruction, numerical function regression, text classification, summarization, molecule captioning, time-series classification, graph classification, and fMRI decoding, Vector-ICL often surpasses both few-shot ICL and domain-specific model or tuning. We further conduct analyses and case studies, indicating the potential of LLMs to process vector representations beyond traditional token-based paradigms.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,REGENT: A Retrieval-Augmented Generalist Agent That Can Act In-Context in New Environments,"Building generalist agents that can rapidly adapt to new environments is a key challenge for deploying AI in the digital and real worlds. Is scaling current agent architectures the most effective way to build generalist agents? We propose a novel approach to pre-train relatively small policies on relatively small datasets and adapt them to unseen environments via in-context learning, without any finetuning. Our key idea is that retrieval offers a powerful bias for fast adaptation. Indeed, we demonstrate that even a simple retrieval-based 1-nearest neighbor agent offers a surprisingly strong baseline for today's state-of-the-art generalist agents. From this starting point, we construct a semi-parametric agent, REGENT, that trains a transformer-based policy on sequences of queries and retrieved neighbors. REGENT can generalize to unseen robotics and game-playing environments via retrieval augmentation and in-context learning, achieving this with up to 3x fewer parameters and up to an order-of-magnitude fewer pre-training datapoints, significantly outperforming today's state-of-the-art generalist agents.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICLR,2025,ZIP: An Efficient Zeroth-order Prompt Tuning for Black-box Vision-Language Models,"Recent studies have introduced various approaches for prompt-tuning black-box vision-language models, referred to as black-box prompt-tuning (BBPT). While BBPT has demonstrated considerable potential, it is often found that many existing methods require an excessive number of queries (i.e., function evaluations), which poses a significant challenge in real-world scenarios where the number of allowed queries is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose Zeroth-order Intrinsic-dimensional Prompt-tuning (ZIP), a novel approach that enables efficient and robust prompt optimization in a purely black-box setting. The key idea of ZIP is to reduce the problem dimensionality and the variance of zeroth-order gradient estimates, such that the training is done fast with far less queries. We achieve this by re-parameterizing prompts in low-rank representations and designing intrinsic-dimensional clipping of estimated gradients. We evaluate ZIP on 13+ vision-language tasks in standard benchmarks and show that it achieves an average improvement of approximately 6% in few-shot accuracy and 48% in query efficiency compared to the best-performing alternative BBPT methods, establishing a new state of the art. Our ablation analysis further shows that the proposed clipping mechanism is robust and nearly optimal, without the need to manually select the clipping threshold, matching the result of expensive hyperparameter search.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICLR,2025,In-Context Editing: Learning Knowledge from Self-Induced Distributions,"In scenarios where language models must incorporate new information efficiently without extensive retraining, traditional fine-tuning methods are prone to overfitting, degraded generalization, and unnatural language generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Consistent In-Context Editing (ICE), a novel approach leveraging the model's in-context learning capability to optimize towards a contextual distribution rather than a one-hot target. ICE introduces a simple yet effective optimization framework for the model to internalize new knowledge by aligning its output distributions with and without additional context. This method enhances the robustness and effectiveness of gradient-based tuning methods, preventing overfitting and preserving the model's integrity. We analyze ICE across four critical aspects of knowledge editing: accuracy, locality, generalization, and linguistic quality, demonstrating its advantages. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of ICE and demonstrate its potential for continual editing, ensuring that the integrity of the model is preserved while updating information.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Streaming Video Question-Answering with In-context Video KV-Cache Retrieval,"We propose ReKV, a novel training-free approach that enables efficient streaming video question-answering (StreamingVQA), by seamlessly integrating with existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Traditional VideoQA systems struggle with long videos, as they must process entire videos before responding to queries, and repeat this process for each new question. In contrast, our approach analyzes long videos in a streaming manner, allowing for prompt responses as soon as user queries are received. Building on a common Video-LLM, we first incorporate a sliding-window attention mechanism, ensuring that input frames attend to a limited number of preceding frames, thereby reducing computational overhead. To prevent information loss, we store processed video key-value caches (KV-Caches) in RAM and disk, reloading them into GPU memory as needed. Additionally, we introduce a retrieval method that leverages an external retriever or the parameters within Video-LLMs to retrieve only query-relevant KV-Caches, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in question answering. ReKV enables the separation of video analyzing and question-answering across different processes and GPUs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of StreamingVQA. Through comprehensive experimentation, we validate the efficacy and practicality of our approach, which significantly boosts efficiency and enhances applicability over existing VideoQA models.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,AHA: A Vision-Language-Model for Detecting and Reasoning Over Failures in Robotic Manipulation,"Robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not only task execution but also the ability to detect and learn from failures. While recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have improved robots' spatial reasoning and problem-solving abilities, they still struggle with failure recognition, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce AHA, an open-source VLM designed to detect and reason about failures in robotic manipulation using natural language. By framing failure detection as a free-form reasoning task, AHA identifies failures and provides detailed, adaptable explanations across different robots, tasks, and environments. We fine-tuned AHA using FailGen, a scalable framework that generates the first large-scale dataset of robotic failure trajectories, the AHA dataset. FailGen achieves this by procedurally perturbing successful demonstrations from simulation. Despite being trained solely on the AHA dataset, AHA generalizes effectively to real-world failure datasets, robotic systems, and unseen tasks. It surpasses the second-best model (GPT-4o in-context learning) by 10.3% and exceeds the average performance of six compared models including five state-of-the-art VLMs by 35.3% across multiple metrics and datasets. We integrate AHA into three manipulation frameworks that utilize LLMs/VLMs for reinforcement learning, task and motion planning, and zero-shot trajectory generation. AHA’s failure feedback enhances these policies' performances by refining dense reward functions, optimizing task planning, and improving sub-task verification, boosting task success rates by an average of 21.4% across all three tasks compared to GPT-4 models.

ICLR,2025,Learning to Adapt Frozen CLIP for Few-Shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation,"Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention.  To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW. \href{https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/L2C}{Our Code: L2C}",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICLR,2025,Revisiting In-context Learning Inference Circuit in Large Language Models,"In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm on Language Models (LMs) with inner mechanisms un-explored. There are already existing works describing the inner processing of ICL, while they struggle to capture all the inference phenomena in large language models. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive circuit to model the inference dynamics and try to explain the observed phenomena of ICL. In detail, we divide ICL inference into 3 major operations: (1) Input Text Encode: LMs encode every input text (in the demonstrations and queries) into linear representation in the hidden states with sufficient information to solve ICL tasks. (2) Semantics Merge: LMs merge the encoded representations of demonstrations with their corresponding label tokens to produce joint representations of labels and demonstrations. (3) Feature Retrieval and Copy: LMs search the joint representations of demonstrations similar to the query representation on a task subspace, and copy the searched representations into the query. Then, language model heads capture these copied label representations to a certain extent and decode them into predicted labels. Through careful measurements, the proposed inference circuit successfully captures and unifies many fragmented phenomena observed during the ICL process, making it a comprehensive and practical explanation of the ICL inference process. Moreover, ablation analysis by disabling the proposed steps seriously damages the ICL performance, suggesting the proposed inference circuit is a dominating mechanism. Additionally, we confirm and list some bypass mechanisms that solve ICL tasks in parallel with the proposed circuit.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICLR,2025,Correlation and Navigation in the Vocabulary Key Representation Space of Language Models,"Language model (LM) decoding is based on the next-token prediction (NTP) probability distribution. For neural LMs (e.g., Transformer-based), NTP distribution is
essentially a softmax-regularized dot product between an encoded input context
(query) and fixed vocabulary representations (keys). In this paper, we study the
effect of the key distribution on the NTP distribution, with a focus on whether
the similarity between keys will trigger spurious correlations in NTP. Through
knowledge-probing tasks, we show that in the NTP distribution, the few top-ranked
tokens are typically accurate. However, the middle-ranked prediction is highly biased
towards the tokens that are distributionally (not necessarily semantically) similar to
these top ones. For instance, if “P” is predicted as the top-1 token, “A”-“Z” will all
be ranked high in NTP, no matter whether they can lead to correct decoding results.
This hurts the sampling diversity and makes the sampling of correct, long-tail
results hopeless and noisy. We attempt to alleviate this issue via a novel in-context
method that iteratively pushes the query representation away from explored regions.
Specifically, we include the explored decoding results in the context and prompt
the LM to generate something else, which encourages the LM to produce a query
representation that has small dot products with explored keys. Experiments on
knowledge-probing tasks show that our method leads to efficient navigation away
from explored keys to correct new keys. We further extend our method to open-ended and chain-of-thought (for reasoning) generation. Experiment results show
that ICN contributes to better generation diversity and improved self-consistency
voting performance. Finally, we discuss potential training issues caused by the
fixed key space together with the challenges and possible ways to address them in
future research.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICLR,2025,Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training,"Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an ``uncertainty token'' without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

ICLR,2025,Gated Delta Networks: Improving Mamba2 with Delta Rule,"Linear Transformers have gained attention as efficient alternatives to standard Transformers, but their performance in retrieval and long-context tasks has been limited.  To address these limitations, recent work has explored two distinct mechanisms: gating for adaptive memory control and the delta update rule for precise memory modifications. We observe that these mechanisms are complementary—gating enables rapid memory erasure while the delta rule facilitates targeted updates. Building on this insight, we introduce the gated delta rule and develop a parallel training algorithm optimized for modern hardware. Our proposed architecture, Gated DeltaNet, consistently surpasses existing models like Mamba2 and DeltaNet across multiple benchmarks, including language modeling, common-sense reasoning, in-context retrieval, length extrapolation, and long-context understanding.

ICLR,2025,UniMatch: Universal Matching from Atom to Task for Few-Shot Drug Discovery,"Drug discovery is crucial for identifying candidate drugs for various diseases. However, its low success rate often results in a scarcity of annotations, posing a few-shot learning problem. Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-
learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels—atoms, substructures, and molecules—via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in ∆AUPRC.

ICML,2023,Adaptive IMLE for Few-shot Pretraining-free Generative Modelling,"Despite their success on large datasets, GANs have been difficult to apply in the few-shot setting, where only a limited number of training examples are provided. Due to mode collapse, GANs tend to ignore some training examples, causing overfitting to a subset of the training dataset, which is small in the first place. A recent method called Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) is an alternative to GAN that tries to address this issue. It uses the same kind of generators as GANs but trains it with a different objective that encourages mode coverage. However, the theoretical guarantees of IMLE hold under a restrictive condition that the optimal likelihood at all data points is the same. In this paper, we present a more generalized formulation of IMLE which includes the original formulation as a special case, and we prove that the theoretical guarantees hold under weaker conditions. Using this generalized formulation, we further derive a new algorithm, which we dub Adaptive IMLE, which can adapt to the varying difficulty of different training examples. We demonstrate on multiple few-shot image synthesis datasets that our method significantly outperforms existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mehranagh20/AdaIMLE.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,Task-Specific Skill Localization in Fine-tuned Language Models,"Pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned to solve diverse NLP tasks, including in few-shot settings. Thus fine-tuning allows the model to quickly pick up task-specific ""skills,"" but there has been limited study of *where* these newly-learnt skills reside inside the massive model. This paper introduces the term *skill localization* for this problem and proposes a solution. Given the downstream task and a model fine-tuned on that task, a simple optimization is used to identify a very small subset of parameters ($\sim$0.01% of model parameters) responsible for (>95%) of the model's performance, in the sense that *grafting* the fine-tuned values for just this tiny subset onto the pre-trained model gives performance almost as well as the fine-tuned model. While reminiscent of recent works on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, the novel aspects here are that: (i) No further retraining is needed on the subset (unlike, say, with lottery tickets). (ii) Notable improvements are seen over vanilla fine-tuning with respect to calibration of predictions in-distribution (40-90% error reduction) as well as quality of predictions out-of-distribution (OOD). In models trained on multiple tasks, a stronger notion of skill localization is observed, where the sparse regions corresponding to different tasks are almost disjoint, and their overlap (when it happens) is a proxy for task similarity. Experiments suggest that localization via grafting can assist certain forms continual learning.",🎯 特定技术方法

We show that with only 5 examples of high-quality translation data shown at inference, a transformer decoder-only model trained solely with self-supervised learning, is able to match specialized supervised state-of-the-art models as well as more general commercial translation systems. In particular, we outperform the best performing system on the WMT'21 English-Chinese news translation task by only using five examples of English-Chinese parallel data at inference. Furthermore, the resulting models are two orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art language models. We then analyze the factors which impact the performance of few-shot translation systems, and highlight that the quality of the few-shot demonstrations heavily determines the quality of the translations generated by our models.

CTreeOT includes an alignment algorithm that extends the popular Sinkhorn algorithm for matching tree nodes while supporting constraints on tree edges. The algorithm involves alternating between matrix rescaling and message passing updates, and can be efficiently expressed as GPU tensor operations. The second part of CTreeOT is fine-grained relevance-based reweighting of nodes that makes the match scores useful for prediction tasks.

ICML,2023,Deja Vu: Contextual Sparsity for Efficient LLMs at Inference Time,"Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo LLM's in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in wall-clock time without compromising LLM's quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference latency of OPT-175B by over 2$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art FasterTransformer, and over 6$\times$ compared to the widely used Hugging Face implementation, without compromising model quality.

We find task balancing and enrichment techniques are overlooked but critical to effective instruction tuning, and in particular, training with mixed prompt settings (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) actually yields equivalent or stronger (2%) performance in all settings. In further experiments we show Flan-T5 requires less finetuning to converge higher and faster than T5 on single downstream tasks -- motivating instruction-tuned models as more computationally-efficient starting checkpoints for new tasks.

ICML,2023,Transformers Learn In-Context by Gradient Descent,"At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2023,Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning,"The surprising ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is believed to emerge only in very large-scale models. We show that such abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT-3.5 (≥ 175B) to T5 variants (≤ 11B). We propose model specialization, to specialize the model’s ability towards a target task. The hypothesis is that large models (commonly viewed as larger than 100B) have strong modeling power such that they can perform a large spectrum of tasks. Small models (commonly viewed as smaller than 10B) have limited model capacity, but if we specialize their capacity towards a target task, the model can achieve decent performance improvements. We use multi-step math reasoning as our testbed because it is a very typical emergent ability. We show two important aspects of model abilities: (1) balancing language model’s performance on multiple tasks is a delicate matter, as improvements on one task may compromise other tasks; (2) yet by intentionally paying the price of decreased generic ability, we can clearly improve across different model scales smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability. We further give comprehensive discussions about important design choices for better generalization, including the data format mixture and the start model checkpoint. We hope our practice and discoveries can serve as an important attempt towards specialized smaller models in the new research paradigm set by LLMs.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2023,PAL: Program-aided Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time (""few-shot prompting""). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as ""chain-of-thought"", which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and others. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on GSM8K, surpassing PaLM which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-1.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2023,Uncertainty Estimation by Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning,"Uncertainty estimation is a key factor that makes deep learning reliable in practical applications. Recently proposed evidential neural networks explicitly account for different uncertainties by treating the network's outputs as evidence to parameterize the Dirichlet distribution, and achieve impressive performance in uncertainty estimation. However, for high data uncertainty samples but annotated with the one-hot label, the evidence-learning process for those mislabeled classes is over-penalized and remains hindered. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning ($\mathcal{I}$-EDL). In particular, we introduce Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to measure the informativeness of evidence carried by each sample, according to which we can dynamically reweight the objective loss terms to make the network more focus on the representation learning of uncertain classes. The generalization ability of our network is further improved by optimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. As demonstrated empirically, our proposed method consistently outperforms traditional EDL-related algorithms in multiple uncertainty estimation tasks, especially in the more challenging few-shot classification settings.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,MyoDex: A Generalizable Prior for Dexterous Manipulation,"Human dexterity is a hallmark of motor control behaviors. Our hands can rapidly synthesize new behaviors despite the complexity (multi-articular and multi-joints, with 23 joints controlled by more than 40 muscles) of mosculoskeletal control. In this work, we take inspiration from how human dexterity builds on a diversity of prior experiences, instead of being acquired through a single task. Motivated by this observation, we set out to develop agents that can build upon previous experience to quickly acquire new (previously unattainable) behaviors. Specifically, our approach leverages multi-task learning to implicitly capture a task-agnostic behavioral priors (MyoDex) for human-like dexterity, using a physiologically realistic human hand model -- MyoHand. We demonstrate MyoDex's effectiveness in few-shot generalization as well as positive transfer to a large repertoire of unseen dexterous manipulation tasks. MyoDex can solve approximately 3x more tasks and it can accelerate the achievement of solutions by about 4x in comparison to a distillation baseline. While prior work has synthesized single musculoskeletal control behaviors, MyoDex is the first generalizable manipulation prior that catalyzes the learning of dexterous physiological control across a large variety of contact-rich behaviors.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2023,GeCoNeRF: Few-shot Neural Radiance Fields via Geometric Consistency,"We present a novel framework to regularize Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in a few-shot setting with a geometry-aware consistency regularization. The proposed approach leverages a rendered depth map at unobserved viewpoint to warp sparse input images to the unobserved viewpoint and impose them as pseudo ground truths to facilitate learning of NeRF. By encouraging such geometry-aware consistency at a feature-level instead of using pixel-level reconstruction loss, we regularize the NeRF at semantic and structural levels while allowing for modeling view dependent radiance to account for color variations across viewpoints. We also propose an effective method to filter out erroneous warped solutions, along with training strategies to stabilize training during optimization. We show that our model achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF models.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Efficient Training of Language Models using Few-Shot Learning,"Large deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and demonstrated remarkable few-shot learning performance. However, training them is often challenging and resource-intensive. In this paper, we study an efficient approach to train language models using few-shot learners. We show that, by leveraging the fast learning nature of few-shot learners, one can train language models efficiently in a stagewise manner. Our main insight is that stacking a good few-shot learner on a good small language model provides a good initializer for a larger language model. Using this insight and building upon progressive stacking approaches, we develop novel approaches for training such networks in a stagewise manner. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical framework and accompanying empirical studies to support our insights, thereby creating a theoretical foundation for progressive stacking. Finally, we provide empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training time of few-shot learners.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning,"Large pretrained language models (LMs) have shown impressive In-Context Learning (ICL) ability, where the model learns to do an unseen task simply by conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples as demonstration, without any parameter updates. The performance of ICL is highly dominated by the quality of the selected in-context examples. However, previous selection methods are mostly based on simple heuristics, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we systematically formulate in-context example selection as a subset selection problem, and optimize it in an end-to-end fashion. We propose CEIL (Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning), which is instantiated by Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to model the interaction between the given input and in-context examples, and optimized through carefully-designed contrastive learning to obtain preference from LMs. We validate CEIL on 12 classification and generation datasets from 7 distinct NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, phraphrase detection, natural language inference, commonsense reasoning, open-domain question answering, code generation and semantic parsing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, compositionality of CEIL, shedding new lights on in-context leaning.

ICML,2023,Evaluating Self-Supervised Learning via Risk Decomposition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is typically evaluated using a single metric (linear probing on ImageNet), which neither provides insight into tradeoffs between models nor highlights how to improve them. To address this, we propose an SSL risk decomposition, which generalizes the classical approximation-estimation decomposition. Our decomposition consists of four error terms: approximation, representation usability, probe generalization, and encoder generalization. We provide efficient estimators for each term and use them to analyze the effect of 30 design choices on 169 SSL vision models evaluated on ImageNet. Our analysis gives valuable insights for designing and using SSL models. For example, it highlights the main source of errors and shows how to improve SSL in specific settings (full- vs few-shot) by trading off error components.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2023,Statistical Foundations of Prior-Data Fitted Networks,"Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) were recently proposed as a new paradigm for machine learning. Instead of training the network to an observed training set, a fixed model is pre-trained offline on small, simulated training sets from a variety of tasks. The pre-trained model is then used to infer class probabilities in-context on fresh training sets with arbitrary size and distribution. Empirically, PFNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks with similar size to the ones used in pre-training. Surprisingly, their accuracy further improves when passed larger data sets during inference. This article establishes a theoretical foundation for PFNs and illuminates the statistical mechanisms governing their behavior. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, a purely frequentistic interpretation of PFNs as pre-tuned, but untrained predictors explains their behavior. A predictor's variance vanishes if its sensitivity to individual training samples does and the bias vanishes only if it is appropriately localized around the test feature. The transformer architecture used in current PFN implementations ensures only the former. These findings shall prove useful for designing architectures with favorable empirical behavior.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling,"How do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce *Pythia*, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend *Pythia* to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics.

ICML,2023,Lifelong Language Pretraining with Distribution-Specialized Experts,"Pretraining on a large-scale corpus has become a standard method to build general language models (LMs). Adapting a model to new data distributions targeting different downstream tasks poses significant challenges. Naive fine-tuning may incur catastrophic forgetting when the over-parameterized LMs overfit the new data but fail to preserve the pretrained features. Lifelong learning (LLL) aims to enable information systems to learn from a continuous data stream across time. However, most prior work modifies the training recipe assuming a static fixed network architecture. We find that additional model capacity and proper regularization are key elements to achieving strong LLL performance. Thus, we propose Lifelong-MoE, an extensible MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) architecture that dynamically adds model capacity via adding experts with regularized pretaining. Our results show that by only introducing a limited number of extra experts while keeping the computation cost constant, our model can steadily adapt to data distribution shifts while preserving the previous knowledge. Compared to existing lifelong learning approaches, Lifelong-MoE achieves better few-shot performance on NLP tasks. More impressively, Lifelong-MoE surpasses multi-task learning on 19 downstream NLU tasks.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2023,Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning,"In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2023,MetaModulation: Learning Variational Feature Hierarchies for Few-Shot Learning with Fewer Tasks,"Meta-learning algorithms are able to learn a new task using previously learned knowledge, but they often require a large number of meta-training tasks which may not be readily available. To address this issue, we propose a method for few-shot learning with fewer tasks, which we call MetaModulation. The key idea is to use a neural network to increase the density of the meta-training tasks by modulating batch normalization parameters during meta-training. Additionally, we modify parameters at various neural network levels, rather than just a single layer, to increase task diversity. To account for the uncertainty caused by the reduced number of training tasks, we propose a variational MetaModulation where the modulation parameters are treated as latent variables. We also introduce learning variational feature hierarchies by the variational MetaModulation, which modulates features at all layers and can take into account task uncertainty and generate more diverse tasks. The ablation studies illustrate the advantages of utilizing a learnable task modulation at different levels and demonstrate the benefit of incorporating probabilistic variants in few-task meta-learning. Our MetaModulation and its variational variants consistently outperform state-of-the-art alternatives on four few-task meta-learning benchmarks.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,SemSup-XC: Semantic Supervision for Zero and Few-shot Extreme Classification,"Extreme classification (XC) involves predicting over large numbers of classes (thousands to millions), with real-world applications like news article classification and e-commerce product tagging. The zero-shot version of this task requires generalization to novel classes without additional supervision. In this paper, we develop SemSup-XC, a model that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance on three XC datasets derived from legal, e-commerce, and Wikipedia data. To develop SemSup-XC, we use automatically collected semantic class descriptions to represent classes and facilitate generalization through a novel hybrid matching module that matches input instances to class descriptions using a combination of semantic and lexical similarity. Trained with contrastive learning, SemSup-XC significantly outperforms baselines and establishes state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets considered, gaining up to 12 precision points on zero-shot and more than 10 precision points on one-shot tests, with similar gains for recall@10. Our ablation studies highlight the relative importance of our hybrid matching module and automatically collected class descriptions.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2023,Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning,"This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose a component sparsification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2023,Do Embodied Agents Dream of Pixelated Sheep: Embodied Decision Making using Language Guided World Modelling,"Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically learn tabula rasa, without prior knowledge of the world. However, if initialized with knowledge of high-level subgoals and transitions between subgoals, RL agents could utilize this Abstract World Model (AWM) for planning and exploration. We propose using few-shot large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize an AWM, that will be verified through world experience, to improve sample efficiency of RL agents. Our DECKARD agent applies LLM-guided exploration to item crafting in Minecraft in two phases: (1) the Dream phase where the agent uses an LLM to decompose a task into a sequence of subgoals, the hypothesized AWM; and (2) the Wake phase where the agent learns a modular policy for each subgoal and verifies or corrects the hypothesized AWM. Our method of hypothesizing an AWM with LLMs and then verifying the AWM based on agent experience not only increases sample efficiency over contemporary methods by an order of magnitude but is also robust to and corrects errors in the LLM, successfully blending noisy internet-scale information from LLMs with knowledge grounded in environment dynamics.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2023,Synergies between Disentanglement and Sparsity: Generalization and Identifiability in Multi-Task Learning,"Although disentangled representations are often said to be beneficial for downstream tasks, current empirical and theoretical understanding is limited. In this work, we provide evidence that disentangled representations coupled with sparse task-specific predictors improve generalization. In the context of multi-task learning, we prove a new identifiability result that provides conditions under which maximally sparse predictors yield disentangled representations. Motivated by this theoretical result, we propose a practical approach to learn disentangled representations based on a sparsity-promoting bi-level optimization problem. Finally, we explore a meta-learning version of this algorithm based on group Lasso multiclass SVM predictors, for which we derive a tractable dual formulation. It obtains competitive results on standard few-shot classification benchmarks, while each task is using only a fraction of the learned representations.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2023,PromptBoosting: Black-Box Text Classification with Ten Forward Passes,"We describe PromptBoosting, a query-efficient procedure for building a text classifier from a neural language model (LM) without access to the LM's parameters, gradients, or hidden representations. This form of ""black-box"" classifier training has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale LMs has grown. But existing black-box LM classifier learning approaches are themselves computationally inefficient, typically specializing LMs to the target task by searching in a large space of (discrete or continuous) prompts using zeroth-order optimization methods. Instead of directly optimizing in prompt space, PromptBoosting obtains a small pool of prompts via a gradient-free approach and then constructs a large pool of weak learners by pairing these prompts with different elements of the LM's output distribution. These weak learners are then ensembled using the AdaBoost algorithm. The entire learning process requires only a small number of forward passes and no backward pass. Experiments show that PromptBoosting achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple black-box few-shot classification tasks, and matches or outperforms full fine-tuning in both few-shot and standard learning paradigms, while training 10x faster than existing black-box methods.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Human-Timescale Adaptation in an Open-Ended Task Space,"Foundation models have shown impressive adaptation and scalability in supervised and self-supervised learning problems, but so far these successes have not fully translated to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we demonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context learning algorithm that can adapt to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as quickly as humans. In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients: (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based memory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic scaling laws with respect to network size, memory length, and richness of the training task distribution. We believe our results lay the foundation for increasingly general and adaptive RL agents that perform well across ever-larger open-ended domains.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2023,Tuning Language Models as Training Data Generators for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning,"Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods, improving no-augmentation methods by 5+ average points, and outperforming augmentation methods by 3+ average points.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,HyperTuning:  Toward Adapting Large Language Models without Back-propagation,"Fine-tuning large language models for different tasks can be costly and inefficient, and even methods that reduce the number of tuned parameters still require full gradient-based optimization. We propose HyperTuning, a novel approach to model adaptation that uses a hypermodel to generate task-specific parameters for a fixed downstream model. We demonstrate a simple setup for hypertuning with HyperT5, a T5-based hypermodel that produces soft prefixes or LoRA parameters for a frozen T5 model from few-shot examples. We train HyperT5 in two stages: first, hyperpretraining with a modified conditional language modeling objective that trains a hypermodel to generate parameters; second, multi-task fine-tuning (MTF) on a large number of diverse language tasks. We evaluate HyperT5 on P3, MetaICL and Super-NaturalInstructions datasets, and show that it can effectively generate parameters for unseen tasks. Moreover, we show that using hypermodel-generated parameters as initializations for further parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves performance. HyperTuning can thus be a flexible and efficient way to leverage large language models for diverse downstream applications.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Grounding Language Models to Images for Multimodal Inputs and Outputs,"We propose an efficient method to ground pretrained text-only language models to the visual domain, enabling them to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text data, and generate text interleaved with retrieved images. Our method leverages the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. We keep the language model frozen, and finetune input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows our model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs, and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images. We achieve strong zero-shot performance on grounded tasks such as contextual image retrieval and multimodal dialogue, and showcase compelling interactive abilities. Our approach works with any off-the-shelf language model and paves the way towards an effective, general solution for leveraging pretrained language models in visually grounded settings.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Enhancing Activity Prediction Models in Drug Discovery with the Ability to Understand Human Language,"Activity and property prediction models are the central workhorses in drug discovery and materials sciences, but currently, they have to be trained or fine-tuned for new tasks. Without training or fine-tuning, scientific language models could be used for such low-data tasks through their announced zero- and few-shot capabilities. However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pretraining objective on data from large biochemical databases.

ICML,2023,FusionRetro: Molecule Representation Fusion via In-Context Learning for Retrosynthetic Planning,"Retrosynthetic planning aims to devise a complete multi-step synthetic route from starting materials to a target molecule. Current strategies use a decoupled approach of single-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms, taking only the product as the input to predict the reactants for each planning step and ignoring valuable context information along the synthetic route. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes context information for improved retrosynthetic planning. We view synthetic routes as reaction graphs and propose to incorporate context through three principled steps: encode molecules into embeddings, aggregate information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. Our approach is the first attempt to utilize in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction in retrosynthetic planning. The entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion and produce more practical and accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by fusing in the context information over routes, our model significantly improves the performance of retrosynthetic planning over baselines that are not context-aware, especially for long synthetic routes.

ICML,2023,Diversity-enhancing Generative Network for Few-shot Hypothesis Adaptation,"Generating unlabeled data has been recently shown to help address the few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA) problem, where we aim to train a classifier for the target domain with a few labeled target-domain data and a well-trained source-domain classifier (i.e., a source hypothesis), for the additional information of the highly-compatible unlabeled data. However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective for addressing the FHA problem. Experimental results show that the DEG-Net outperforms existing FHA baselines and further verifies that generating diverse data plays an important role in addressing the FHA problem.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,Interval Bound Interpolation for Few-shot Learning with Few Tasks,"Few-shot learning aims to transfer the knowledge acquired from training on a diverse set of tasks to unseen tasks from the same task distribution, with a limited amount of labeled data. The underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good representation of the task manifold. This becomes more difficult when only a limited number of tasks are available for training. In such a few-task few-shot setting, it is beneficial to explicitly preserve the local neighborhoods from the task manifold and exploit this to generate artificial tasks for training. To this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective bounds. We then use a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective interval bounds. We apply our framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains in comparison to recent methods.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2023,MEWL: Few-shot multimodal word learning with referential uncertainty,"Without explicit feedback, humans can rapidly learn the meaning of words. Children can acquire a new word after just a few passive exposures, a process known as fast mapping. This word learning capability is believed to be the most fundamental building block of multimodal understanding and reasoning. Despite recent advancements in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded visual scenes. MEWL covers human's core cognitive toolkits in word learning: cross-situational reasoning, bootstrapping, and pragmatic learning. Specifically, MEWL is a few-shot benchmark suite consisting of nine tasks for probing various word learning capabilities. These tasks are carefully designed to be aligned with the children's core abilities in word learning and echo the theories in the developmental literature. By evaluating multimodal and unimodal agents' performance with a comparative analysis of human performance, we notice a sharp divergence in human and machine word learning. We further discuss these differences between humans and machines and call for human-like few-shot word learning in machines.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,Revisiting Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: Theory and Implications,"A large-scale deep model pre-trained on massive labeled or unlabeled data transfers well to downstream tasks. Linear evaluation freezes parameters in the pre-trained model and trains a linear classifier separately, which is efficient and attractive for transfer. However, little work has investigated the classifier in linear evaluation except for the default logistic regression. Inspired by the statistical efficiency of naive Bayes, the paper revisits the classical topic on discriminative vs. generative classifiers. Theoretically, the paper considers the surrogate loss instead of the zero-one loss in analyses and generalizes the classical results from binary cases to multiclass ones. We show that, under mild assumptions, multiclass naive Bayes requires $O(\log n)$ samples to approach its asymptotic error while the corresponding multiclass logistic regression requires $O(n)$ samples, where $n$ is the feature dimension. To establish it, we present a multiclass $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bound framework and an explicit bound for logistic loss, which are of independent interests. Simulation results on a mixture of Gaussian validate our theoretical findings. Experiments on various pre-trained deep vision models show that naive Bayes consistently converges faster as the number of data increases. Besides, naive Bayes shows promise in few-shot cases and we observe the ""two regimes'' phenomenon in pre-trained supervised models.

ICML,2023,The Ideal Continual Learner: An Agent That Never Forgets,"The goal of continual learning is to find a model that solves multiple learning tasks which are presented sequentially to the learner. A key challenge in this setting is that the learner may ""forget"" how to solve a previous task when learning a new task, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, many practical methods have been proposed, including memory-based, regularization-based and expansion-based methods. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theory and practice by proposing a new continual learning framework called ""Ideal Continual Learner"" (ICL), which is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting by construction. We show that ICL unifies multiple well-established continual learning methods and gives new theoretical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. We also derive generalization bounds for ICL which allow us to theoretically quantify ""how rehearsal affects generalization"". Finally, we connect ICL to several classic subjects and research topics of modern interest, which allows us to make historical remarks and inspire future directions.",📊 评测基准与数据集

PFNs are neural processes that are trained to approximate the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) through in-context learning on any prior distribution that can be efficiently sampled from. We describe how this flexibility can be exploited for surrogate modeling in BO. We use PFNs to mimic a naive Gaussian process (GP), an advanced GP, and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). In addition, we show how to incorporate further information into the prior, such as allowing hints about the position of optima (user priors), ignoring irrelevant dimensions, and performing non-myopic BO by learning the acquisition function. The flexibility underlying these extensions opens up vast possibilities for using PFNs for BO. We demonstrate the usefulness of PFNs for BO in a large-scale evaluation on artificial GP samples and three different hyperparameter optimization testbeds: HPO-B, Bayesmark, and PD1.

ICML,2023,Online Prototype Alignment for Few-shot Policy Transfer,"Domain adaptation in RL mainly deals with the changes of observation when transferring the policy to a new environment. Many traditional approaches of domain adaptation in RL manage to learn a mapping function between the source and target domain in explicit or implicit ways. However, they typically require access to abundant data from the target domain. Besides, they often rely on visual clues to learn the mapping function and may fail when the source domain looks quite different from the target domain. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel framework Online Prototype Alignment (OPA) to learn the mapping function based on the functional similarity of elements and is able to achieve few-shot policy transfer within only several episodes. The key insight of OPA is to introduce an exploration mechanism that can interact with the unseen elements of the target domain in an efficient and purposeful manner, and then connect them with the seen elements in the source domain according to their functionalities (instead of visual clues). Experimental results show that when the target domain looks visually different from the source domain, OPA can achieve better transfer performance even with much fewer samples from the target domain, outperforming prior methods.",🎯 特定技术方法

We annotate natural texts through a combination of off-the-shelf NLP tools and simple heuristics with the linguistic and extra-linguistic constraints they satisfy. Then, we verbalize the constraints into natural language instructions to form weakly supervised training data, i.e., we prepend the natural language verbalizations of the constraints in front of their corresponding natural language sentences. Next, we fine-tune a pre-trained language model on the augmented corpus. Compared to existing methods, InstructCTG is more flexible in terms of the types of constraints it allows the practitioner to use. It also does not require any modification of the decoding procedure. Finally, InstructCTG allows the model to adapt to new constraints without re-training through the use of in-context learning.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2023,Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling,"Recent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all their knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). Specifically, for the retriever, we use a pretrained CLIP, and for the generator, we train a CM3 Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities such as faithful image generation and multimodal in-context learning (e.g., image generation from demonstrations).",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2023,A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification Again,"Few-shot classification consists of a training phase where a model is learned on a relatively large dataset and an adaptation phase where the learned model is adapted to previously-unseen tasks with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we empirically prove that the training algorithm and the adaptation algorithm can be completely disentangled, which allows algorithm analysis and design to be done individually for each phase. Our meta-analysis for each phase reveals several interesting insights that may help better understand key aspects of few-shot classification and connections with other fields such as visual representation learning and transfer learning. We hope the insights and research challenges revealed in this paper can inspire future work in related directions.

ICML,2023,Model-agnostic Measure of Generalization Difficulty,"The measure of a machine learning algorithm is the difficulty of the tasks it can perform, and sufficiently difficult tasks are critical drivers of strong machine learning models. However, quantifying the generalization difficulty of machine learning benchmarks has remained challenging. We propose what is to our knowledge the first model-agnostic measure of the inherent generalization difficulty of tasks. Our inductive bias complexity measure quantifies the total information required to generalize well on a task minus the information provided by the data. It does so by measuring the fractional volume occupied by hypotheses that generalize on a task given that they fit the training data. It scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimensionality of the space over which the model must generalize but only polynomially in resolution per dimension, showing that tasks which require generalizing over many dimensions are drastically more difficult than tasks involving more detail in fewer dimensions. Our measure can be applied to compute and compare supervised learning, reinforcement learning and meta-learning generalization difficulties against each other. We show that applied empirically, it formally quantifies intuitively expected trends, e.g. that in terms of required inductive bias, MNIST $<$ CIFAR10 $<$ Imagenet and fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs) $<$ partially observable MDPs. Further, we show that classification of complex images $<$ few-shot meta-learning with simple images. Our measure provides a quantitative metric to guide the construction of more complex tasks requiring greater inductive bias, and thereby encourages the development of more sophisticated architectures and learning algorithms with more powerful generalization capabilities.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2024,Exact Conversion of In-Context Learning to Model Weights in Linearized-Attention Transformers,"In-Context Learning (ICL) has been a powerful emergent property of large language models that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In contrast to regular gradient-based learning, ICL is highly interpretable and does not require parameter updates. In this paper, we show that, for linearized transformer networks, ICL can be made explicit and permanent through the inclusion of bias terms. We mathematically demonstrate the equivalence between a model with ICL demonstration prompts and the same model with the additional bias terms. Our algorithm (ICLCA) allows for exact conversion in an inexpensive manner. Existing methods are not exact and require expensive parameter updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments that show the exact incorporation of ICL tokens into a linear transformer. We further suggest how our method can be adapted to achieve cheap approximate conversion of ICL tokens, even in regular transformer networks that are not linearized. Our experiments on GPT-2 show that, even though the conversion is only approximate, the model still gains valuable context from the included bias terms.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,One Prompt is not Enough: Automated Construction of a Mixture-of-Expert Prompts,"Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities to novel tasks when prompted with language instructions and in-context demos. Since this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have been explored to automate the instruction design. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they also restricted the searched prompt to one instruction. Such simplification significantly limits their capacity, as a single demo-free instruction might not be able to cover the entire complex problem space of the targeted task. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm and divide the problem space into a set of sub-regions; Each sub-region is governed by a specialized expert, equipped with both an instruction and a set of demos. A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression, we group demos into experts based on their semantic similarity; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search of an instruction per expert complements the demos assigned to it, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), achieves an average win rate of 81% against prior arts across several major benchmarks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Prompting is a Double-Edged Sword: Improving Worst-Group Robustness of Foundation Models,"Machine learning models fail catastrophically under distribution shift, but a surprisingly effective way to empirically improve robustness to some types of shift (*e.g.*, Imagenet-A/C) is to use stronger open-vocabulary classifiers derived from foundation models. In this work, we first note that for shifts governed by spurious correlations (features spuriously correlated with the label on the training data, but not on test), the zero-shot and few-shot performance of foundation models is no better than ERM models, and remains unchanged when pretrained data/model size is scaled. Secondly, even in these situations, foundation models are quite accurate at predicting the value of the spurious feature. In a simplified setup, we theoretically analyze both these findings. Specifically, we show that during contrastive pretraining, the simplicity bias of foundation models tends to result in the learning of features that mostly rely on the spurious attribute, compared to more robust features. We leverage these observations to propose Prompting for Robustness (PfR) which first uses foundation models to zero-shot predict the spurious attribute on labeled examples, and then learns a classifier with balanced performance across different groups of labels and spurious attribute. Across 5 vision and language tasks, we show that PfR's performance nearly equals that of an oracle algorithm (group DRO) that leverages human labeled spurious attributes.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2024,LangCell: Language-Cell Pre-training for Cell Identity Understanding,"Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, has become an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity. More specifically, we introduce **LangCell**, the first **Lang**uage-**Cell** pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell identity understanding scenarios.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff,"Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at ""recall"", the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's recurrent state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the Pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to $1.3$b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 10.36 accuracy points. We further develop IO-aware algorithms that enable BASED to provide 24× higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. Overall, BASED expands the Pareto frontier of the throughput-recall tradeoff space beyond prior architectures.",⚡ 效率优化
ICML,2024,Efficient Adaptation in Mixed-Motive Environments via Hierarchical Opponent Modeling and Planning,"Despite the recent successes of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, efficiently adapting to co-players in mixed-motive environments remains a significant challenge. One feasible approach is to hierarchically model co-players' behavior based on inferring their characteristics. However, these methods often encounter difficulties in efficient reasoning and utilization of inferred information. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Opponent modeling and Planning (HOP), a novel multi-agent decision-making algorithm that enables few-shot adaptation to unseen policies in mixed-motive environments. HOP is hierarchically composed of two modules: an opponent modeling module that infers others' goals and learns corresponding goal-conditioned policies, and a planning module that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to identify the best response. Our approach improves efficiency by updating beliefs about others' goals both across and within episodes and by using information from the opponent modeling module to guide planning. Experimental results demonstrate that in mixed-motive environments, HOP exhibits superior few-shot adaptation capabilities when interacting with various unseen agents, and excels in self-play scenarios. Furthermore, the emergence of social intelligence during our experiments underscores the potential of our approach in complex multi-agent environments.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用

It inspires researchers to train end-to-end MLLMs or utilize large models to generate policies with human-selected prompts for embodied agents. However, these methods exhibit limited generalization capabilities on unseen tasks or scenarios, and overlook the multimodal environment information which is critical for robots to make decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel **Robo**tic **M**ultimodal **P**erception-**P**lanning (**RoboMP$^2$**) framework for robotic manipulation which consists of a Goal-Conditioned Multimodal Preceptor (GCMP) and a Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Planner (RAMP).

ICML,2024,FlashST: A Simple and Universal Prompt-Tuning Framework for Traffic Prediction,"The objective of traffic prediction is to accurately forecast and analyze the dynamics of transportation patterns, considering both space and time. However, the presence of distribution shift poses a significant challenge in this field, as existing models struggle to generalize well when faced with test data that significantly differs from the training distribution. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a simple and universal spatio-temporal prompt-tuning framework-FlashST, which adapts pre-trained models to the specific characteristics of diverse downstream datasets, improving generalization in diverse traffic prediction scenarios. Specifically, the FlashST framework employs a lightweight spatio-temporal prompt network for in-context learning, capturing spatio-temporal invariant knowledge and facilitating effective adaptation to diverse scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate a distribution mapping mechanism to align the data distributions of pre-training and downstream data, facilitating effective knowledge transfer in spatio-temporal forecasting.

ICML,2024,RLVF: Learning from Verbal Feedback without Overgeneralization,"The diversity of contexts in which large language models (LLMs) are deployed requires the ability to modify or customize default model behaviors to incorporate nuanced requirements and preferences. A convenient interface to specify such model adjustments is high-level verbal feedback, such as “Don’t use emojis when drafting emails to my boss.” However, while writing high-level feedback is far simpler than collecting annotations for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we find that simply prompting a model with such feedback leads to $\textbf{overgeneralization}$–applying feedback in contexts where it is not relevant. We propose a new method Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO) to learn from high-level verbal feedback while reducing overgeneralization compared to current work. C3PO uses a piece of high-level feedback to generate a small synthetic preference dataset to specify when and how the feedback should (and should not) be applied. It then fine-tunes the model in accordance with the synthetic preference data while minimizing the divergence from the original model for prompts where the feedback does not apply. Our experimental results indicate that our approach effectively applies verbal feedback to relevant scenarios while preserving existing behaviors for other contexts more than current methods. For both human- and GPT-4-generated high-level feedback, C3PO effectively adheres to the given feedback comparably to in-context baselines while reducing overgeneralization by 30%.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2024,Position: Understanding LLMs Requires More Than Statistical Generalization,"The last decade has seen blossoming research in deep learning theory attempting to answer, ``Why does deep learning generalize?"" A powerful shift in perspective precipitated this progress: the study of overparametrized models in the interpolation regime. In this paper, we argue that another perspective shift is due, since some of the desirable qualities of LLMs are not a consequence of good statistical generalization and require a separate theoretical explanation. Our core argument relies on the observation that AR probabilistic models are inherently non-identifiable: models zero or near-zero KL divergence apart---thus, equivalent test loss---can exhibit markedly different behaviors. We support our position with mathematical examples and empirical observations, illustrating why non-identifiability has practical relevance through three case studies: (1) the non-identifiability of zero-shot rule extrapolation; (2) the approximate non-identifiability of in-context learning; and (3) the non-identifiability of fine-tunability. We review promising research directions focusing on LLM-relevant generalization measures, transferability, and inductive biases.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Can Looped Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent for In-context Learning?,"Transformers to do reasoning and few-shot learning, without any fine-tuning, is widely conjectured to stem from their ability to implicitly simulate a multi-step algorithms -- such as gradient descent -- with their weights in a single forward pass. Recently, there has been progress in understanding this complex phenomenon from an expressivity point of view, by demonstrating that Transformers can express such multi-step algorithms. However, our knowledge about the more fundamental aspect of its learnability, beyond single layer models, is very limited. In particular, *can training Transformers enable convergence to algorithmic solutions*? In this work we resolve this for in context linear regression with linear looped Transformers -- a multi-layer model with weight sharing that is conjectured to have an inductive bias to learn fix-point iterative algorithms. More specifically, for this setting we show that the global minimizer of the population training loss implements multi-step preconditioned gradient descent, with a preconditioner that adapts to the data distribution. Furthermore, we show a fast convergence for gradient flow on the regression loss, despite the non-convexity of the landscape, by proving a novel gradient dominance condition. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis for multi-layer Transformer in this setting. We further validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2024,In-Context Freeze-Thaw Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Optimization,"With the increasing computational costs associated with deep learning, automated hyperparameter optimization methods, strongly relying on black-box Bayesian optimization (BO), face limitations. Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative,  strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations. However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work, we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformers' in-context learning ability to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work. Furthermore, we show that, when combined with our novel acquisition mechanism (MFPI-random), the resulting in-context freeze-thaw BO method (ifBO), yields new state-of-the-art performance in the same three families of deep learning HPO benchmarks considered in prior work.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2024,Embodied CoT Distillation From LLM To Off-the-shelf Agents,"We address the challenge of utilizing large language models (LLMs) for complex embodied tasks, in the environment where decision-making systems operate timely on capacity-limited, off-the-shelf devices. We present DeDer, a framework for decomposing and distilling the embodied reasoning capabilities from LLMs to efficient, small language model (sLM)-based policies. In DeDer, the decision-making process of LLM-based strategies is restructured into a hierarchy with a reasoning-policy and planning-policy. The reasoning-policy is distilled from the data that is generated through the embodied in-context learning and self-verification of an LLM, so it can produce effective rationales. The planning-policy, guided by the rationales, can render optimized plans efficiently. In turn, DeDer allows for adopting sLMs for both policies, deployed on off-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of intermediate rationales, specific to embodied tasks, we devise the embodied knowledge graph, and to generate multiple rationales timely through a single inference, we also use the contrastively prompted attention model. Our experiments with the ALFRED benchmark demonstrate that DeDer surpasses leading language planning and distillation approaches, indicating the applicability and efficiency of sLM-based embodied policies derived through DeDer.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用

Furthermore, we show that this effect reverses when learning about counterfactual feedback and disappears when no agency is implied. We corroborate these findings by investigating idealized in-context learning agents derived through meta-reinforcement learning, where we observe similar patterns. Taken together, our results contribute to our understanding of how in-context learning works by highlighting that the framing of a problem significantly influences how learning occurs, a phenomenon also observed in human cognition.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用

ICML,2024,Towards an Understanding of Stepwise Inference in Transformers: A Synthetic Graph Navigation Model,"Stepwise inference protocols, such as scratchpads and chain-of-thought, help language models solve complex problems by decomposing them into a sequence of simpler subproblems. To unravel the underlying mechanisms of stepwise inference we propose to study autoregressive Transformer models on a synthetic task that embodies the multi-step nature of problems where stepwise inference is generally most useful. Specifically, we define a graph navigation problem wherein a model is tasked with traversing a path from a start to a goal node on the graph. We find we can empirically reproduce and analyze several phenomena observed at scale: (i) the stepwise inference reasoning gap, the cause of which we find in the structure of the training data; (ii) a diversity-accuracy trade-off in model generations as sampling temperature varies; (iii) a simplicity bias in the model’s output; and (iv) compositional generalization and a primacy bias with in-context exemplars. Overall, our work introduces a grounded, synthetic framework for studying stepwise inference and offers mechanistic hypotheses that can lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2024,From Words to Actions: Unveiling the Theoretical Underpinnings of LLM-Driven Autonomous Systems,"In this work, from a theoretical lens, we aim to understand why large language model (LLM) empowered agents are able to solve decision-making problems in the physical world. To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution, respectively. Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals via prompting. Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning (BAIL) through in-context learning. Additionally, we highlight the necessity for exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy, we introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small. Finally, we extend our theoretical framework to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination among multiple Actors.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,Transformers Learn Nonlinear Features In Context: Nonconvex Mean-field Dynamics on the Attention Landscape,"Large language models based on the Transformer architecture have demonstrated impressive capabilities to learn in context. However, existing theoretical studies on how this phenomenon arises are limited to the dynamics of a single layer of attention trained on linear regression tasks. In this paper, we study the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer. The MLP acts as a common nonlinear representation or feature map, greatly enhancing the power of in-context learning. We prove in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign. We also analyze the second-order stability of mean-field dynamics and show that Wasserstein gradient flow almost always avoids saddle points. Furthermore, we establish novel methods for obtaining concrete improvement rates both away from and near critical points. This represents the first saddle point analysis of mean-field dynamics in general and the techniques are of independent interest.",⚡ 效率优化
ICML,2024,QuRating: Selecting High-Quality Data for Training Language Models,"Selecting high-quality pre-training data is important for creating capable language models, but existing methods rely on simple heuristics. We introduce QuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that can capture human intuitions about data quality. In this paper, we investigate four qualities - writing style, required expertise, facts & trivia, and educational value - and find that LLMs are able to discern these qualities, especially when making pairwise judgments of texts. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratings from pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus with quality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select 30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameter language models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balance quality and diversity. When we sample using quality ratings as logits over documents, our models obtain lower perplexity and stronger in-context learning performance than baselines. Our best model is based on educational value and performs similarly to a model trained with uniform sampling for 50% more steps. Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a training curriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset. We extensively analyze the quality ratings and discuss their characteristics, biases, and wider implications.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,In-context Learning on Function Classes Unveiled for Transformers,"Transformer-based neural sequence models exhibit a remarkable ability to perform in-context learning. Given some training examples, a pre-trained model can make accurate predictions on an unseen input. This paper studies why transformers can learn different types of function classes in-context. We first show by construction that there exists a family of transformers (with different activation functions) that implement approximate gradient descent on the parameters of neural networks, and we provide an upper bound for the number of heads, hidden dimensions, and layers of the transformer. We also show that a transformer can learn linear functions, the indicator function of a unit ball, and smooth functions in-context by learning neural networks that approximate them. The above instances mainly focus on a transformer pre-trained on single tasks. We also prove that when pre-trained on two tasks: linear regression and classification, a transformer can make accurate predictions on both tasks simultaneously. Our results move beyond linearity in terms of in-context learning instances and provide a comprehensive understanding of why transformers can learn many types of function classes through the bridge of neural networks.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,Meta-Reinforcement Learning Robust to Distributional Shift Via Performing Lifelong In-Context Learning,"A key challenge in Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL) is the task distribution shift, since the generalization ability of most current meta-RL methods is limited to tasks sampled from the training distribution. In this paper, we propose Posterior Sampling Bayesian Lifelong In-Context Reinforcement Learning (PSBL), which is robust to task distribution shift. PSBL meta-trains a variant of transformer to directly perform amortized inference about the Predictive Posterior Distribution (PPD) of the optimal policy. Once trained, the network can infer the PPD online with frozen parameters. The agent then samples actions from the approximate PPD to perform online exploration, which progressively reduces uncertainty and enhances performance in the interaction with the environment. This property is known as in-context learning.

ICML,2024,Unsupervised Episode Generation for Graph Meta-learning,"We propose Unsupervised Episode Generation method called **Neighbors as Queries (NaQ)** to solve the Few-Shot Node-Classification (FSNC) task by *unsupervised Graph Meta-learning*. Doing so enables full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective *unsupervised* episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is *model-agnostic*, any existing supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them.

Unfortunately, LM agents often fail to generalize to new environments without human demonstrations. This work presents BAGEL, a method for bootstrapping LM agents without human supervision. BAGEL converts a seed set of randomly explored trajectories to synthetic demonstrations via round-trips between two noisy LM components: an LM labeler which converts a trajectory into a synthetic instruction, and a zero-shot LM agent which maps the synthetic instruction into a refined trajectory. By performing these round-trips iteratively, BAGEL quickly converts the initial distribution of trajectories towards those that are well-described by natural language. We adapt the base LM agent at test time with in-context learning by retrieving relevant BAGEL demonstrations based on the instruction, and find improvements of over 2-13% absolute on ToolQA and MiniWob++, with up to 13x reduction in execution failures.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability,"Jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent (suffix) attack with continuation constraint, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with paraphrasing constraint, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with position constraint. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability.

ICML,2024,In-context Vectors: Making In Context Learning More Effective and Controllable Through Latent Space Steering,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emergent in-context learning capabilities, where they adapt to new tasks based on example demonstrations. However, in-context learning has seen limited effectiveness in many settings, is difficult to quantitatively control and takes up context window space. To overcome these limitations, we propose an alternative approach that recasts in-context learning as in-context vectors (ICV). Using ICV has two steps. We first use a forward pass on demonstration examples to create the in-context vector from the latent embedding of the LLM. This vector captures essential information about the intended task. On a new query, instead of adding demonstrations to the prompt, we shift the latent states of the LLM using the ICV. The ICV approach has several benefits: 1) it enables the LLM to more effectively follow the demonstration examples; 2) it's easy to control by adjusting the magnitude of the ICV; 3) it reduces the length of the prompt by removing the in-context demonstrations; 4) ICV is computationally much more efficient than fine-tuning. We demonstrate that ICV achieves better performance compared to standard in-context learning and fine-tuning on diverse tasks including safety, style transfer, role-playing and formatting. Moreover, we show that we can flexibly teach LLM to simultaneously follow different types of instructions by simple vector arithmetics on the corresponding ICVs.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2024,Bidirectional Reciprocative Information Communication for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Existing few-shot semantic segmentation methods typically rely on a one-way flow of category information from support to query, ignoring the impact of intra-class diversity. To address this, drawing inspiration from cybernetics, we introduce a Query Feedback Branch (QFB) to propagate query information back to support, generating a query-related support prototype that is more aligned with the query. Subsequently, a Query Amplifier Branch (QAB) is employed to amplify target objects in the query using the acquired support prototype. To further improve the model, we propose a Query Rectification Module (QRM), which utilizes the prediction disparity in the query before and after support activation to identify challenging positive and negative samples from ambiguous regions for query self-rectification. Furthermore, we integrate the QFB, QAB, and QRM into a feedback and rectification layer and incorporate it into an iterative pipeline. This configuration enables the progressive enhancement of bidirectional reciprocative flow of category information between query and support, effectively providing query-adaptive support information and addressing the intra-class diversity problem. Extensive experiments conducted on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/LIUYUANWEI98/IFRNet .",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2024,VisionGraph: Leveraging Large Multimodal Models for Graph Theory Problems in Visual Context,"Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive success in visual reasoning, particularly in visual mathematics. However, problem-solving capabilities in graph theory remain less explored for LMMs, despite being a crucial aspect of mathematical reasoning that requires an accurate understanding of graphical structures and multi-step reasoning on visual graphs. To step forward in this direction, we are the first to design a benchmark named **VisionGraph**, used to explore the capabilities of advanced LMMs in solving multimodal graph theory problems. It encompasses eight complex graph problem tasks, from connectivity to shortest path problems. Subsequently, we present a Description-Program-Reasoning (DPR) chain to enhance the logical accuracy of reasoning processes through graphical structure description generation and algorithm-aware multi-step reasoning. Our extensive study shows that 1) GPT-4V outperforms Gemini Pro in multi-step graph reasoning; 2) All LMMs exhibit inferior perception accuracy for graphical structures, whether in zero/few-shot settings or with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which further affects problem-solving performance; 3) DPR significantly improves the multi-step graph reasoning capabilities of LMMs and the GPT-4V (DPR) agent achieves SOTA performance.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2024,Trainable Transformer in Transformer,"Recent works attribute the capability of in-context learning (ICL) in large pre-trained language models to implicitly simulating and fine-tuning an internal model (e.g., linear or 2-layer MLP) during inference. However, such constructions require large memory overhead, which makes simulation of more sophisticated internal models intractable. In this work, we propose a new efficient construction, Transformer in Transformer (in short, TINT), that allows a transformer to simulate and fine-tune more complex models during inference (e.g., pre-trained language models). In particular, we introduce innovative approximation techniques that allow a TINT model with less than 2 billion parameters to simulate and fine-tune a 125 million parameter transformer model within a single forward pass. TINT accommodates many common transformer variants and its design ideas also improve the efficiency of past instantiations of simple models inside transformers. We conduct end-to-end experiments to validate the internal fine-tuning procedure of TINT on various language modeling and downstream tasks. For example, even with a limited one-step budget, we observe TINT for a OPT-125M model improves performance by 4 − 16% absolute on average compared to OPT-125M. These findings suggest that large pre-trained language models are capable of performing intricate subroutines. To facilitate further work, a modular and extensible codebase for TINT is included.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,How Transformers Learn Causal Structure with Gradient Descent,"The incredible success of transformers on sequence modeling tasks can be largely attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which allows information to be transferred between different parts of a sequence. Self-attention allows transformers to encode causal structure which makes them particularly suitable for sequence modeling. However, the process by which transformers learn such causal structure via gradient-based training algorithms remains poorly understood. To better understand this process, we introduce an in-context learning task that requires learning latent causal structure. We prove that gradient descent on a simplified two-layer transformer learns to solve this task by encoding the latent causal graph in the first attention layer. The key insight of our proof is that the gradient of the attention matrix encodes the mutual information between tokens. As a consequence of the data processing inequality, the largest entries of this gradient correspond to edges in the latent causal graph. As a special case, when the sequences are generated from in-context Markov chains, we prove that transformers learn an induction head (Olsson et al., 2022). We confirm our theoretical findings by showing that transformers trained on our in-context learning task are able to recover a wide variety of causal structures.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,In-Context Principle Learning from Mistakes,"In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific “principles” from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo and Claude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2024,How Do Nonlinear Transformers Learn and Generalize in In-Context Learning?,"Transformer-based large language models have displayed impressive in-context learning capabilities, where a pre-trained model can handle new tasks without fine-tuning by simply augmenting the query with some input-output examples from that task. Despite the empirical success, the mechanics of how to train a Transformer to achieve ICL and the corresponding ICL capacity is mostly elusive due to the technical challenges of analyzing the nonconvex training problems resulting from the nonlinear self-attention and nonlinear activation in Transformers. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of Transformers with nonlinear self-attention and nonlinear MLP, together with the ICL generalization capability of the resulting model. Focusing on a group of binary classification tasks, we train Transformers using data from a subset of these tasks and quantify the impact of various factors on the ICL generalization performance on the remaining unseen tasks with and without data distribution shifts. We also analyze how different components in the learned Transformers contribute to the ICL performance. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical analysis of how model pruning affects ICL performance and prove that proper magnitude-based pruning can have a minimal impact on ICL while reducing inference costs. These theoretical findings are justified through numerical experiments.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性

In this study, we therefore addressed the problem of finding multiple solutions from a single task in offline RL. We propose algorithms that can learn multiple solutions in offline RL, and empirically investigate their performance. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm learns multiple qualitatively and quantitatively distinctive solutions in offline RL.",🧺 其他/未归类

This raises an urgent need to carefully analyse their robustness so that stakeholders can understand if and when such models are trustworthy enough to be relied upon in any given application. In this paper, we highlight a specific vulnerability in popular models, namely permutation sensitivity in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Specifically, we show empirically that popular models are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting, which is surprising as models should ideally be as invariant to prompt permutation as humans are. These vulnerabilities persist across various model sizes, and exist in very recent language and vision-language models.

ICML,2024,Enabling Few-Shot Learning with PID Control: A Layer Adaptive Optimizer,"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants have shown remarkable performance in scenarios characterized by a scarcity of labeled data during the training phase of machine learning models. Despite these successes, MAMLbased approaches encounter significant challenges when there is a substantial discrepancy in the distribution of training and testing tasks, resulting in inefficient learning and limited generalization across domains. Inspired by classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control theory, this study introduces a Layer-Adaptive PID (LA-PID) Optimizer, a MAML-based optimizer that employs efficient parameter optimization methods to dynamically adjust task-specific PID control gains at each layer of the network, conducting a first-principles analysis of optimal convergence conditions. A series of experiments conducted on four standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the LA-PID optimizer, indicating that LA-PID achieves state-oftheart performance in few-shot classification and cross-domain tasks, accomplishing these objectives with fewer training steps.

ICML,2024,DOGE: Domain Reweighting with Generalization Estimation,"The coverage and composition of the pretraining data significantly impacts the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, recent LLMs still rely on heuristics and trial and error to increase or reduce the influence of data-domains. We propose DOmain reweighting with Generalization Estimation (DoGE), which optimizes the probability of sampling from each domain (domain weights) in a principled way. Our approach is a two stage process consisting (i) training a proxy model to obtain domain weights using a bi-level optimization algorithm; (ii) training a larger base model by sampling training domains according to the learnt domain weights. In our experiments, we extensively show how DoGE improves the generalization of the base model to any target data mixture. On the SlimPajama dataset, our base model gets a better perplexity and few-shot reasoning accuracies across 6 tasks compared to baseline methods. Moreover, aiming to generalize to out-of-domain target tasks, which is unseen in the pretraining corpus (OOD domain), DoGE can effectively identify inter-domain dependencies, consistently achieves better test perplexity on the target domain.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2024,Is In-Context Learning in Large Language Models Bayesian? A Martingale Perspective,"In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a particularly remarkable characteristic of Large Language Models (LLM): given a pretrained LLM and an observed dataset, LLMs can make predictions for new data points from the same distribution without fine-tuning. Numerous works have postulated ICL as approximately Bayesian inference, rendering this a natural hypothesis. In this work, we analyse this hypothesis from a new angle through the *martingale property*, a fundamental requirement of a Bayesian learning system for exchangeable data. We show that the martingale property is a necessary condition for unambiguous predictions in such scenarios, and enables a principled, decomposed notion of uncertainty vital in trustworthy, safety-critical systems. We derive actionable checks with corresponding theory and test statistics which must hold if the martingale property is satisfied. We also examine if uncertainty in LLMs decreases as expected in Bayesian learning when more data is observed. In three experiments, we provide evidence for violations of the martingale property, and deviations from a Bayesian scaling behaviour of uncertainty, falsifying the hypothesis that ICL is Bayesian.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2024,Skill Set Optimization: Reinforcing Language Model Behavior via Transferable Skills,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used for sequential decision making in interactive environments. However, leveraging environment reward signals for continual LLM actor improvement is not straightforward. We propose Skill Set Optimization (SSO) for improving LLM actor performance through constructing and refining sets of transferable skills. SSO constructs skills by extracting common subtrajectories with high rewards and generating subgoals and instructions to represent each skill. These skills are provided to the LLM actor in-context to reinforce behaviors with high rewards. Then, SSO further refines the skill set by pruning skills that do not continue to result in high rewards. We evaluate our method in the classic videogame NetHack and the text environment ScienceWorld to demonstrate SSO's ability to optimize a set of skills and perform in-context policy improvement. SSO outperforms baselines by 40% in our custom NetHack task and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in ScienceWorld by 35%.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2024,Fewer Truncations Improve Language Modeling,"In large language model training, input documents are typically concatenated together and then split into sequences of equal length to avoid padding tokens. Despite its efficiency, the concatenation approach compromises data integrity—it inevitably breaks many documents into incomplete pieces, leading to excessive truncations that hinder the model from learning to compose logically coherent and factually consistent content that is grounded on the complete context. To address the issue, we propose Best-fit Packing, a scalable and efficient method that packs documents into training sequences through length-aware combinatorial optimization. Our method completely eliminates unnecessary truncations while retaining the same training efficiency as concatenation. Empirical results from both text and code pre-training show that our method achieves superior performance (e.g., +4.7% on reading comprehension; +16.8% in context following; and +9.2% on program synthesis), and reduces closed-domain hallucination effectively by up to 58.3%.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2024,LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Targeted Instruction Tuning,"Instruction tuning has unlocked powerful capabilities in large language models (LLMs), using combined datasets to develop general-purpose chatbots. However, real-world applications often require a specialized suite of skills (e.g., reasoning). The challenge lies in identifying the most relevant data from these extensive datasets to effectively develop specific capabilities, a setting we frame as *targeted instruction tuning*. We propose LESS, an optimizer-aware and practically efficient algorithm to estimate data influences and perform **L**ow-rank gradi**E**nt **S**imilarity **S**earch for instruction data selection. Crucially, LESS adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length instruction data. LESS first constructs a highly reusable and transferable *gradient datastore* with low-dimensional gradient features and then selects examples based on their similarity to few-shot examples embodying a specific capability. Experiments show that training on a LESS-selected 5% of the data can often outperform training on the full dataset across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, the selected data is highly transferable: smaller models can be leveraged to select useful data for larger models and models from different families. Our qualitative analysis shows that our method goes beyond surface form cues to identify data that exemplifies the necessary reasoning skills for the intended downstream application. To facilitate future work, we release code and data at [princeton-nlp/LESS](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/LESS).",📚 Prompt工程与优化

ICML,2024,Algorithm of Thoughts: Enhancing Exploration of Ideas in Large Language Models,"Current literature, aiming to surpass the ""Chain-of-Thought"" approach, often resorts to external modi operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. Due to their *myopic perspective*, they escalate the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the *Algorithm of Thoughts*---a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways. By employing algorithmic examples fully in-context, this overarching view of the whole process exploits the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and even more recent multi-query strategies that employ an extensive tree search algorithms while using significantly fewer tokens. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches.

ICML,2024,Generalization to New Sequential Decision Making Tasks with In-Context Learning,"Training autonomous agents that can learn new tasks from only a handful of demonstrations is a long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently, transformers have been shown to learn new language or vision tasks without any weight updates from only a few examples, also referred to as in-context learning. However, the sequential decision making setting poses additional challenges having a lower tolerance for errors since the environment's stochasticity or the agent's actions can lead to unseen, and sometimes unrecoverable, states. In this paper, we use an illustrative example to show that naively applying transformers to sequential decision making problems does not enable in-context learning of new tasks. We then demonstrate how training on sequences of trajectories with certain distributional properties leads to in-context learning of new sequential decision making tasks. We investigate different design choices and find that larger model and dataset sizes, as well as more task diversity, environment stochasticity, and trajectory burstiness, all result in better in-context learning of new out-of-distribution tasks. By training on large diverse offline datasets, our model is able to learn new MiniHack and Procgen tasks without any weight updates from just a handful of demonstrations.",📊 评测基准与数据集

However, as LMs are scaled up, the memory requirements for backpropagation become prohibitively high. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods can leverage memory-efficient forward passes to estimate gradients. More recently, MeZO, an adaptation of ZO-SGD, has been shown to consistently outperform zero-shot and in-context learning when combined with suitable task prompts. In this work, we couple ZO methods with variance reduction techniques to enhance stability and convergence for inference-based LM fine-tuning. We introduce Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (MeZO-SVRG) and demonstrate its efficacy across multiple LM fine-tuning tasks, eliminating the reliance on task-specific prompts. Evaluated across a range of both masked and autoregressive LMs on benchmark GLUE tasks, MeZO-SVRG outperforms MeZO with up to 20% increase in test accuracies in both full- and partial-parameter fine-tuning settings. MeZO-SVRG benefits from reduced computation time as it often surpasses MeZO's peak test accuracy with a $2\times$ reduction in GPU-hours. MeZO-SVRG significantly reduces the required memory footprint compared to first-order SGD, i.e. by $2\times$ for autoregressive models.

ICML,2024,What needs to go right for an induction head? A mechanistic study of in-context learning circuits and their formation,"In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models. Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit element that may be critical for in-context learning – the induction head (IH), which performs a match-and-copy operation. During training of large transformers on natural language data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phase change in the loss. Despite the robust evidence for IHs and this interesting coincidence with the phase change, relatively little is known about the diversity and emergence dynamics of IHs. Why is there more than one IH, and how are they dependent on each other? Why do IHs appear all of a sudden, and what are the subcircuits that enable them to emerge? We answer these questions by studying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting by training on synthetic data. In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired causal framework for modifying activations throughout training. Using this framework, we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs. By ""clamping"" subsets of activations throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuits that interact to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change. Furthermore, these subcircuits shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such as phase change timing, already showing the promise of this more in-depth understanding of subcircuits that need to ""go right"" for an induction head.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用

ICML,2024,"Reason for Future, Act for Now: A Principled Architecture for Autonomous LLM Agents","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but translating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In particular, it is unclear how to complete a given task provably within a minimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an internal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose the first framework with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we call *reason for future, act for now* (**RAFA**). Specifically, we design a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a future trajectory over a long horizon (*reason for future*). At each step, the LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (*act for now*), stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state. The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt LLMs with the memory buffer to estimate the unknown environment (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps that maximize a value function (planning). The learning and planning subroutines are performed in an in-context manner to emulate the actor-critic update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis establishes a $\sqrt{T}$ regret, while our experimental validation demonstrates superior empirical performance.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,In-Context Language Learning: Architectures and Algorithms,"Some neural language models (LMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning (ICL): they can fit predictors to datasets provided as input. While the mechanisms underlying ICL are well-studied in the context of synthetic problems like in-context linear regression, there is still some divergence between these model problems and the “real” ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text corpora. In this paper, we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term in context language learning (ICLL). In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set of strings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the same language. We focus on in- context learning of regular languages generated by random finite automata. We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models on regular ICLL tasks. We first show that Transformers significantly outperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutional representations on ICLL tasks. Next, we provide evidence that they do so by computing in-context n-gram statistics using specialized attention heads.

In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality.

However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives.

In this study, we aim to understand the underlying mechanisms of LLM hallucinations from the perspective of *inner representations*.

Leveraging this signal, we propose an entropy-based metric to quantify the *sharpness* among the in-context hidden states and incorporate it into the decoding process, i.e, use the entropy value to adjust the next token prediction distribution to improve the factuality and overall quality of the generated text. Experiments on knowledge-seeking datasets (Natural Questions, HotpotQA, TriviaQA) and hallucination benchmark (TruthfulQA) demonstrate our consistent effectiveness, e.g., up to 8.6 absolute points on TruthfulQA.

To encapsulate task relationships while filtering out background noise, Patch-grained Task Attention (PTA) is designed to maintain a dynamic knowledge pool consolidating diverse patterns from historical tasks. MetaFormer demonstrates coherence and compatibility with off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers and shows significant improvements in both inductive and transductive few-shot learning scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.77% and 6.25% on 12 in-domain and 10 cross-domain datasets, respectively.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Unleashing the Power of Meta-tuning for Few-shot Generalization Through Sparse Interpolated Experts,"Recent successes suggest that parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models is becoming the state-of-the-art method for transfer learning in vision, gradually replacing the rich literature of alternatives such as meta-learning. In trying to harness the best of both worlds, meta-tuning introduces a subsequent optimization stage of foundation models but has so far only shown limited success and crucially tends to underperform on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. In this paper, we introduce Sparse MetA-Tuning (SMAT), a method inspired by sparse mixture-of-experts approaches and trained to isolate subsets of pre-trained parameters automatically for meta-tuning on each task. SMAT successfully overcomes OOD sensitivity and delivers on the promise of enhancing the transfer abilities of vision foundation models beyond parameter-efficient finetuning. We establish new state-of-the-art results on a challenging combination of Meta-Dataset augmented with additional OOD tasks in both zero-shot and gradient-based adaptation settings. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of the superiority of learned over hand-designed sparsity patterns for sparse expert methods and the pivotal importance of the sparsity level in balancing between in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Our code and models are publicly available.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,How do Transformers Perform In-Context Autoregressive Learning ?,"Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in language modeling tasks. However, the reasons behind their tremendous success are still unclear. In this paper, towards a better understanding, we train a Transformer model on a simple next token prediction task, where sequences are generated as a first-order autoregressive process $s_{t+1} = W s_t$. We show how a trained Transformer predicts the next token by first learning $W$ in-context, then applying a prediction mapping. We call the resulting procedure *in-context autoregressive learning*. More precisely, focusing on commuting orthogonal matrices $W$, we first show that a trained one-layer linear Transformer implements one step of gradient descent for the minimization of an inner objective function, when considering augmented tokens. When the tokens are not augmented, we characterize the global minima of a one-layer diagonal linear multi-head Transformer. Importantly, we exhibit orthogonality between heads and show that positional encoding captures trigonometric relations in the data. On the experimental side, we consider the general case of non-commuting orthogonal matrices and generalize our theoretical findings.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Few-shot Adaptation to Distribution Shifts By Mixing Source and Target Embeddings,"Pretrained machine learning models need to be adapted to distribution shifts when deployed in new target environments. When obtaining labeled data from the target distribution is expensive, few-shot adaptation with only a few examples from the target distribution becomes essential. In this work, we propose MixPro, a lightweight and highly data-efficient approach for few-shot adaptation. MixPro first generates a relatively large dataset by mixing (linearly combining) pre-trained embeddings of large source data with those of the few target examples. This process preserves important features of both source and target distributions, while mitigating the specific noise in the small target data. Then, it trains a linear classifier on the mixed embeddings to effectively adapts the model to the target distribution without overfitting the small target data. Theoretically, we demonstrate the advantages of MixPro over previous methods. Our experiments, conducted across various model architectures on 8 datasets featuring different types of distribution shifts, reveal that MixPro can outperform baselines by as much as 7%, with only 2-4 target examples.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,Compositional Text-to-Image Generation with Dense Blob Representations,"Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow complex text prompts, raising the need for extra grounding inputs for better controllability. In this work, we propose to decompose a scene into visual primitives - denoted as dense blob representations - that contain fine-grained details of the scene while being modular, human-interpretable, and easy-to-construct. Based on blob representations, we develop a blob-grounded text-to-image diffusion model, termed BlobGEN, for compositional generation. Particularly, we introduce a new masked cross-attention module to disentangle the fusion between blob representations and visual features. To leverage the compositionality of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a new in-context learning approach to generate blob representations from text prompts. Our extensive experiments show that BlobGEN achieves superior zero-shot generation quality and better layout-guided controllability on MS-COCO. When augmented by LLMs, our method exhibits superior numerical and spatial correctness on compositional image generation benchmarks.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Language-Driven Cross-Modal Classifier for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Image Recognition,"Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown powerful zero-shot transfer capabilities in image recognition tasks. Recent approaches typically employ supervised fine-tuning methods to adapt CLIP for zero-shot multi-label image recognition tasks. However, obtaining sufficient multi-label annotated image data for training is challenging and not scalable. In this paper, we propose a new language-driven framework for zero-shot multi-label recognition that eliminates the need for annotated images during training. Leveraging the aligned CLIP multi-modal embedding space, our method utilizes language data generated by LLMs to train a cross-modal classifier, which is subsequently transferred to the visual modality. During inference, directly applying the classifier to visual inputs may limit performance due to the modality gap. To address this issue, we introduce a cross-modal mapping method that maps image embeddings to the language modality while retaining crucial visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other zero-shot multi-label recognition methods and achieves competitive results compared to few-shot methods.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,Bridging Data Gaps in Diffusion Models with Adversarial Noise-Based Transfer Learning,"Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) show significant potential in image generation, yet their performance hinges on having access to large datasets. Previous works, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have tackled the limited data problem by transferring pre-trained models learned with sufficient data. However, those methods are hard to be utilized in DPMs since the distinct differences between DPM-based and GAN-based methods, showing in the unique iterative denoising process integral and the need for many timesteps with no-targeted noise in DPMs. In this paper, we propose a novel DPMs-based transfer learning method, ANT, to address the limited data problem. It includes two strategies: similarity-guided training, which boosts transfer with a classifier, and adversarial noise selection which adaptively chooses targeted noise based on the input image. Extensive experiments in the context of few-shot image generation tasks demonstrate that our method is not only efficient but also excels in terms of image quality and diversity when compared to existing GAN-based and DDPM-based methods.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2024,Position: Do pretrained Transformers Learn In-Context by Gradient Descent?,"The emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs remains a remarkable phenomenon that is partially understood. To explain ICL, recent studies have created theoretical connections to Gradient Descent (GD). We ask, do such connections hold up in actual pre-trained language models? We highlight the limiting assumptions in prior works that make their setup considerably different from the practical setup in which language models are trained. For example, their experimental verification uses *ICL objective* (training models explicitly for ICL), which differs from the emergent ICL in the wild. Furthermore, the theoretical hand-constructed weights used in these studies have properties that don't match those of real LLMs. We also look for evidence in real models. We observe that ICL and GD have different sensitivity to the order in which they observe demonstrations. Finally, we probe and compare the ICL vs. GD hypothesis in a natural setting. We conduct comprehensive empirical analyses on language models pre-trained on natural data (LLaMa-7B). Our comparisons of three performance metrics highlight the inconsistent behavior of ICL and GD as a function of various factors such as datasets, models, and the number of demonstrations. We observe that ICL and GD modify the output distribution of language models differently. These results indicate that *the equivalence between ICL and GD remains an open hypothesis* and calls for further studies.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language generation, understanding, and few-shot learning in recent years. An extensive body of work has explored how their performance may be further improved through the tools of prompting, ranging from verification, self-consistency, or intermediate scratchpads. In this paper, we present a complementary approach to improve language responses where multiple language model instances propose and debate their individual responses and reasoning processes over multiple rounds to arrive at a common final answer. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances mathematical and strategic reasoning across a number of tasks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves the factual validity of generated content, reducing fallacious answers and hallucinations that contemporary models are prone to. Our approach may be directly applied to existing black-box models and uses identical procedure and prompts for all tasks we investigate. Overall, our findings suggest that such ""society of minds"" approach has the potential to significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs and pave the way for further breakthroughs in language generation and understanding.",🧠 推理与思维链

ICML,2024,Q-Probe: A Lightweight Approach to Reward Maximization for Language Models,"We present an approach called Q-probing to adapt a pre-trained language model to maximize a task-specific reward function. At a high level, Q-probing sits between heavier approaches such as finetuning and lighter approaches such as few shot prompting, but can also be combined with either. The idea is to learn a simple linear function on a model's embedding space that can be used to reweight candidate completions. We theoretically show that this sampling procedure is equivalent to a KL-constrained maximization of the Q-probe as the number of samples increases. To train the Q-probes we consider either reward modeling or a class of novel direct policy learning objectives based on importance-weighted policy gradients. With this technique, we see gains in domains with ground-truth rewards (code generation) as well as implicit rewards defined by preference data, even outperforming finetuning in data-limited regimes. Moreover, a Q-probe can be trained on top of an API since it only assumes access to sampling and embeddings.

ICML,2024,Dual Operating Modes of In-Context Learning,"In-context learning (ICL) exhibits dual operating modes: ***task learning***, i.e., acquiring a new skill from in-context samples, and ***task retrieval***, i.e., locating and activating a relevant pretrained skill. Recent theoretical work proposes various mathematical models to analyze ICL, but they cannot fully explain the duality. In this work, we analyze a generalized probabilistic model for pretraining data, obtaining a quantitative understanding of the two operating modes of ICL. Leveraging our analysis, we provide the first explanation of an unexplained phenomenon observed with real-world large language models (LLMs). Under some settings, the ICL risk initially increases and then decreases with more in-context examples. Our analysis offers a plausible explanation for this ""early ascent"" phenomenon: a limited number of in-context samples may lead to the retrieval of an incorrect skill, thereby increasing the risk, which will eventually diminish as task learning takes effect with more in-context samples. We also analyze ICL with biased labels, e.g., zero-shot ICL, where in-context examples are assigned random labels, and predict the bounded efficacy of such approaches. We corroborate our analysis and predictions with extensive experiments with Transformers and LLMs.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,"Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning, Acting, and Planning in Language Models","While language models (LMs) have shown potential across a range of decision-making tasks, their reliance on simple acting processes limits their broad deployment as autonomous agents. In this paper, we introduce Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) -- the first general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. By leveraging the in-context learning ability of LMs, we integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search into LATS to enable LMs as agents, along with LM-powered value functions and self-reflections for proficient exploration and enhanced decision-making. A key feature of our approach is the incorporation of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that surpasses the constraints of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, including programming, interactive question-answering (QA), web navigation, and math, validates the effectiveness and generality of LATS in decision-making while maintaining competitive or improved reasoning performance. Notably, LATS achieves state-of-the-art pass@1 accuracy (92.7%) for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and demonstrates gradient-free performance (average score of 75.9) comparable to gradient-based fine-tuning for web navigation on WebShop with GPT-3.5.

Current in-context RL methods are limited by their strict requirements for data, which needs to be generated by RL agents or labeled with actions from an optimal policy. In order to address this prevalent problem, we propose AD$^\varepsilon$, a new data acquisition approach that enables in-context Reinforcement Learning from noise-induced curriculum. We show that it is viable to construct a synthetic noise injection curriculum which helps to obtain learning histories. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to alleviate the need for generation using optimal policies, with in-context RL still able to outperform the best suboptimal policy in a learning dataset by a 2x margin.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Variable Action Spaces,"Recently, it has been shown that transformers pre-trained on diverse datasets with multi-episode contexts can generalize to new reinforcement learning tasks in-context. A key limitation of previously proposed models is their reliance on a predefined action space size and structure. The introduction of a new action space often requires data re-collection and model re-training, which can be costly for some applications. In our work, we show that it is possible to mitigate this issue by proposing the Headless-AD model that, despite being trained only once, is capable of generalizing to discrete action spaces of variable size, semantic content and order. By experimenting with Bernoulli and contextual bandits, as well as a gridworld environment, we show that Headless-AD exhibits significant capability to generalize to action spaces it has never encountered, even outperforming specialized models trained for a specific set of actions on several environment configurations.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,PID: Prompt-Independent Data Protection Against Latent Diffusion Models,"The few-shot fine-tuning of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) has enabled them to grasp new concepts from a limited number of images. However, given the vast amount of personal images accessible online, this capability raises critical concerns about civil privacy. While several previous defense methods have been developed to prevent such misuse of LDMs, they typically assume that the textual prompts used by data protectors exactly match those employed by data exploiters. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that breaking this assumption, i.e., in cases where discrepancies exist between the textual conditions used by protectors and exploiters, could substantially reduces the effectiveness of these defenses. Furthermore, considering the visual encoder's independence from textual prompts, we delve into the visual encoder and thoroughly investigate how manipulating the visual encoder affects the few-shot fine-tuning process of LDMs. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method called Prompt-Independent Defense (PID) to safeguard privacy against LDMs. We show that PID can act as a strong privacy shield on its own while requiring significantly less computational power. We believe our studies, along with the comprehensive understanding and new defense method, provide a notable advance toward reliable data protection against LDMs.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,SAM-E: Leveraging Visual Foundation Model with Sequence Imitation for Embodied Manipulation,"Acquiring a multi-task imitation policy in 3D manipulation poses challenges in terms of scene understanding and action prediction. Current methods employ both 3D representation and multi-view 2D representation to predict the poses of the robot’s end-effector. However, they still require a considerable amount of high-quality robot trajectories, and suffer from limited generalization in unseen tasks and inefficient execution in long-horizon reasoning. In this paper, we propose **SAM-E**, a novel architecture for robot manipulation by leveraging a vision-foundation model for generalizable scene understanding and sequence imitation for long-term action reasoning. Specifically, we adopt Segment Anything (SAM) pre-trained on a huge number of images and promptable masks as the foundation model for extracting task-relevant features, and employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on robot data for a better understanding of embodied scenarios. To address long-horizon reasoning, we develop a novel multi-channel heatmap that enables the prediction of the action sequence in a single pass, notably enhancing execution efficiency. Experimental results from various instruction-following tasks demonstrate that SAM-E achieves superior performance with higher execution efficiency compared to the baselines, and also significantly improves generalization in few-shot adaptation to new tasks.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用

In this paper, we introduce GraphsGPT, featuring an Graph2Seq encoder that transforms Non-Euclidean graphs into learnable Graph Words in the Euclidean space, along with a GraphGPT decoder that reconstructs the original graph from Graph Words to ensure information equivalence. We pretrain GraphsGPT on $100$M molecules and yield some interesting findings: (1) The pretrained Graph2Seq excels in graph representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on $8/9$ graph classification and regression tasks.

ICML,2024,Few-Shot Character Understanding in Movies as an Assessment to Meta-Learning of Theory-of-Mind,"When reading a story, humans can quickly understand new fictional characters with a few observations, mainly by drawing analogies to fictional and real people they already know. This reflects the few-shot and meta-learning essence of humans' inference of characters' mental states, *i.e.*, theory-of-mind (ToM), which is largely ignored in existing research. We fill this gap with a novel NLP dataset in a realistic narrative understanding scenario, ToM-in-AMC. Our dataset consists of $\sim$1,000 parsed movie scripts, each corresponding to a few-shot character understanding task that requires models to mimic humans' ability of fast digesting characters with a few starting scenes in a new movie. We further propose a novel ToM prompting approach designed to explicitly assess the influence of multiple ToM dimensions. It surpasses existing baseline models, underscoring the significance of modeling multiple ToM dimensions for our task. Our extensive human study verifies that humans are capable of solving our problem by inferring characters' mental states based on their previously seen movies.

ICML,2024,In-Context Unlearning: Language Models as Few-Shot Unlearners,"Machine unlearning, the study of efficiently removing the impact of specific training instances on a model, has garnered increased attention in recent years due to regulatory guidelines such as the Right to be Forgotten. Achieving precise unlearning typically involves fully retraining the model and is computationally infeasible in case of very large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, recent work has proposed several algorithms which approximate the removal of training data without retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on access to the model parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not hold in practice due to computational constraints or having only query access to the LLMs. In this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs called ``In-Context Unlearning.'' This method unlearns instances from the model by simply providing specific kinds of inputs in context, without the need to update model parameters. To unlearn specific training instances, we present these instances to the LLMs at inference time along with labels that differ from their ground truth. Our experimental results demonstrate that in-context unlearning performs on par with, or in some cases outperforms other state-of-the-art methods that require access to model parameters, effectively removing the influence of specific instances on the model while preserving test accuracy.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2024,Feedback Loops With Language Models Drive In-Context Reward Hacking,"Language models influence the external world: they query APIs that read and write to web pages, generate content that shapes human behavior, and run system commands as autonomous agents. These interactions form feedback loops: LLM outputs affect the world, which in turn affect subsequent LLM outputs. In this work, we show that feedback loops can cause in-context reward hacking (ICRH), where the LLM at test-time optimizes a (potentially implicit) objective but creates negative side effects in the process. For example, consider an LLM agent deployed to increase Twitter engagement; the LLM may retrieve its previous tweets into the context window and make them more controversial, increasing engagement but also toxicity. We identify and study two processes that lead to ICRH: output-refinement and policy-refinement. For these processes, evaluations on static datasets are insufficient---they miss the feedback effects and thus cannot capture the most harmful behavior. In response, we provide three recommendations for evaluation to capture more instances of ICRH. As AI development accelerates, the effects of feedback loops will proliferate, increasing the need to understand their role in shaping LLM behavior.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,Visual-Text Cross Alignment: Refining the Similarity Score in Vision-Language Models,"It has recently been discovered that using a pre-trained *vision-language model* (VLM), e.g., CLIP, to align a whole query image with several finer text descriptions generated by a large language model can significantly enhance zero-shot performance. However, in this paper, we empirically find that the finer descriptions tend to align more effectively with *local areas of the query image* rather than the whole image, and then we theoretically validate this finding. Thus, we present a method called *weighted visual-text cross alignment* (WCA). This method begins with a *localized visual prompting* technique, designed to identify local visual areas within the query image. The local visual areas are then *cross-aligned* with the finer descriptions by creating a similarity matrix using the pre-trained VLM. To determine how well a query image aligns with each category, we develop a score function based on the weighted similarities in this matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves zero-shot performance across various datasets, achieving results that are even comparable to few-shot learning methods.",🧺 其他/未归类

However, ICL performance can be critically sensitive to the choice of examples. To dynamically select the best examples for every test input, we propose Example Gisting, a novel approach for training example encoders through supervised finetuning with an attention bottleneck between the inputs and outputs. These gist models form the basis for GistScore, a novel metric for scoring and selecting informative examples. Further, we experiment with two variations: (1) finetuning gist models for each dataset and (2) multi-task training a single model on a large collection of datasets. The latter can be used for new tasks out-of-the-box, enabling a training-free ICL pipeline. Evaluations with 21 datasets spanning 9 tasks and 8 diverse LLMs show that our fine-tuned models get state-of-the-art ICL performance with over 20% absolute gain over off-the-shelf retrievers and 5% over the best prior methods.

Their performance can be further enhanced through few-shot prompt tuning methods. However, current studies evaluate the performance of learned prompts separately on base and new classes. This evaluation lacks practicality for real-world applications since downstream tasks cannot determine whether the data belongs to base or new classes in advance. In this paper, we explore a problem setting called ***O**pen-world **P**rompt **T**uning* (OPT), which involves tuning prompts on base classes and evaluating on a combination of base and new classes.

ICML,2024,In-Context Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought,"In-context learning is a promising approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to handle online tasks, which can be achieved by providing task prompts. Recent works demonstrated that in-context RL could emerge with self-improvement in a trial-and-error manner when treating RL tasks as an across-episodic sequential prediction problem. Despite the self-improvement not requiring gradient updates, current works still suffer from high computational costs when the across-episodic sequence increases with task horizons. To this end, we propose an In-context Decision Transformer (IDT) to achieve self-improvement in a high-level trial-and-error manner. Specifically, IDT is inspired by the efficient hierarchical structure of human decision-making and thus reconstructs the sequence to consist of high-level decisions instead of low-level actions that interact with environments. As one high-level decision can guide multi-step low-level actions, IDT naturally avoids excessively long sequences and solves online tasks more efficiently. Experimental results show that IDT achieves state-of-the-art in long-horizon tasks over current in-context RL methods. In particular, the online evaluation time of our IDT is 36$\times$ times faster than baselines in the D4RL benchmark and 27$\times$ times faster in the Grid World benchmark.",🧠 推理与思维链

ICML,2024,MOKD: Cross-domain Finetuning for Few-shot Classification via Maximizing Optimized Kernel Dependence,"In cross-domain few-shot classification, _nearest centroid classifier_ (NCC) aims to learn representations to construct a metric space where few-shot classification can be performed by measuring the similarities between samples and the prototype of each class. An intuition behind NCC is that each sample is pulled closer to the class centroid it belongs to while pushed away from those of other classes. However, in this paper, we find that there exist high similarities between NCC-learned representations of two samples from different classes. In order to address this problem, we propose a bi-level optimization framework, _maximizing optimized kernel dependence_ (MOKD) to learn a set of class-specific representations that match the cluster structures indicated by labeled data of the given task. Specifically, MOKD first optimizes the kernel adopted in *Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion* (HSIC) to obtain the optimized kernel HSIC (opt-HSIC) that can capture the dependence more precisely. Then, an optimization problem regarding the opt-HSIC is addressed to simultaneously maximize the dependence between representations and labels and minimize the dependence among all samples. Extensive experiments on Meta-Dataset demonstrate that MOKD can not only achieve better generalization performance on unseen domains in most cases but also learn better data representation clusters.

ICML,2024,MD tree: a model-diagnostic tree grown on loss landscape,"This paper considers ''model diagnosis'', which we formulate as a classification problem. Given a pre-trained neural network (NN), the goal is to predict the source of failure from a set of failure modes (such as a wrong hyperparameter, inadequate model size, and insufficient data) without knowing the training configuration of the pre-trained NN. The conventional diagnosis approach uses training and validation errors to determine whether the model is underfitting or overfitting. However, we show that rich information about NN performance is encoded in the optimization loss landscape, which provides more actionable insights than validation-based measurements. Therefore, we propose a diagnosis method called MD tree based on loss landscape metrics and experimentally demonstrate its advantage over classical validation-based approaches. We verify the effectiveness of MD tree in multiple practical scenarios: (1) use several models trained on one dataset to diagnose a model trained on another dataset, essentially a few-shot dataset transfer problem; (2) use small models (or models trained with small data) to diagnose big models (or models trained with big data), essentially a scale transfer problem.

ICML,2024,Compositional Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning,"Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is proposed to continually learn from novel classes with only a few samples after the (pre-)training on base classes with sufficient data. However, this remains a challenge. In contrast, humans can easily recognize novel classes with a few samples. Cognitive science demonstrates that an important component of such human capability is compositional learning. This involves identifying visual primitives from learned knowledge and then composing new concepts using these transferred primitives, making incremental learning both effective and interpretable. To imitate human compositional learning, we propose a cognitive-inspired method for the FSCIL task. We define and build a compositional model based on set similarities, and then equip it with a primitive composition module and a primitive reuse module. In the primitive composition module, we propose to utilize the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to approximate the similarity between primitive sets, allowing the training and evaluation based on primitive compositions. In the primitive reuse module, we enhance primitive reusability by classifying inputs based on primitives replaced with the closest primitives from other classes. Experiments on three datasets validate our method, showing it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with improved interpretability.

ICML,2024,Auctionformer: A Unified Deep Learning Algorithm for Solving Equilibrium Strategies in Auction Games,"Auction games have been widely used in plenty of trading environments such as online advertising and real estate. The complexity of real-world scenarios, characterized by diverse auction mechanisms and bidder asymmetries, poses significant challenges in efficiently solving for equilibria. Traditional learning approaches often face limitations due to their specificity to certain settings and high resource demands. Addressing this, we introduce *Auctionformer*, an efficient transformer-based method to solve equilibria of diverse auctions in a unified framework. Leveraging the flexible tokenization schemes, Auctionformer translates varying auction games into a standard token series, making use of renowned Transformer architectures. Moreover, we employ Nash error as the loss term, sidestepping the need for underlying equilibrium solutions and enabling efficient training and inference. Furthermore, a few-shot framework supports adaptability to new mechanisms, reinforced by a self-supervised fine-tuning approach. Extensive experimental results affirm the superior performance of Auctionformer over contemporary methods, heralding its potential for broad real-world applications.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,Eureka-Moments in Transformers: Multi-Step Tasks Reveal Softmax Induced Optimization Problems,"In this work, we study rapid improvements of the training loss in transformers when being confronted with multi-step decision tasks. We found that transformers struggle to learn the intermediate task and both training and validation loss saturate for hundreds of epochs. When transformers finally learn the intermediate task, they do this rapidly and unexpectedly. We call these abrupt improvements Eureka-moments, since the transformer appears to suddenly learn a previously incomprehensible concept. We designed synthetic tasks to study the problem in detail, but the leaps in performance can be observed also for language modeling and in-context learning (ICL). We suspect that these abrupt transitions are caused by the multi-step nature of these tasks. Indeed, we find connections and show that ways to improve on the synthetic multi-step tasks can be used to improve the training of language modeling and ICL. Using the synthetic data we trace the problem back to the Softmax function in the self-attention block of transformers and show ways to alleviate the problem. These fixes reduce the required number of training steps, lead to higher likelihood to learn the intermediate task, to higher final accuracy and training becomes more robust to hyper-parameters.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2024,Beyond Sole Strength: Customized Ensembles for Generalized Vision-Language Models,"Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, for the open-world generalization has gained increasing popularity due to its practical value. However, performance advancements are limited when relying solely on intricate algorithmic designs for a single model, even one exhibiting strong performance, e.g., CLIP-ViT-B/16. This paper, for the first time, explores the collaborative potential of leveraging much weaker VLMs to enhance the generalization of a robust single model. The affirmative findings motivate us to address the generalization problem from a novel perspective, i.e., ensemble of pre-trained VLMs. We introduce three customized ensemble strategies, each tailored to one specific scenario. Firstly, we introduce the zero-shot ensemble, automatically adjusting the logits of different models based on their confidence when only pre-trained VLMs are available. Furthermore, for scenarios with extra few-shot samples, we propose the training-free and tuning ensemble, offering flexibility based on the availability of computing resources.

ICML,2024,Connecting the Dots: Collaborative Fine-tuning for Black-Box Vision-Language Models,"With the emergence of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), considerable efforts have been devoted to fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. Despite the progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a **C**ollabo**ra**tive **F**ine-**T**uning (**CraFT**) approach for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62% compared to the white-box method.

ICML,2024,Meta Evidential Transformer for Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition,"Few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) aims to detect instances from unseen classes by utilizing a small set of labeled instances from closed-set classes. Accurately rejecting instances from open-set classes in the few-shot setting is fundamentally more challenging due to the weaker supervised signals resulting from fewer labels. Transformer-based few-shot methods exploit attention mapping to achieve a consistent representation. However, the softmax-generated attention map normalizes all the instances that assign unnecessary high attentive weights to those instances not close to the closed-set classes that negatively impact the detection performance. In addition, open-set samples that are similar to a certain closed-set class also pose a significant challenge to most existing FSOSR models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta Evidential Transformer (MET) based FSOSR model that uses an evidential open-set loss to learn more compact closed-set class representations by effectively leveraging similar closed-set classes. MET further integrates an evidence-to-variance ratio to detect fundamentally challenging tasks and uses an evidence-guided cross-attention mechanism to better separate the difficult open-set samples. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvement over existing competitive methods in unseen class recognition without deteriorating closed-set performance.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2024,PICLe: Eliciting Diverse Behaviors from Large Language Models with Persona In-Context Learning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive text corpora, which are encoded with diverse personality traits.

Accordingly, we formalize the persona elicitation task, aiming to customize LLM behaviors to align with a target persona. We present Persona In-Context Learning (PICLe), a novel persona elicitation framework grounded in Bayesian inference. At the core, PICLe introduces a new ICL example selection criterion based on likelihood ratio, which is designed to optimally guide the model in eliciting a specific target persona. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PICLe through extensive comparisons against baseline methods across three contemporary LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/picle.",📚 Prompt工程与优化

We explore a neurosymbolic system that learns how to infer programs that capture visual concepts in a domain-general fashion. We introduce Template Programs: programmatic expressions from a domain-specific language that specify structural and parametric patterns common to an input concept. Our framework supports multiple concept-related tasks, including few-shot generation and co-segmentation through parsing. We develop a learning paradigm that allows us to train networks that infer Template Programs directly from visual datasets that contain concept groupings. We run experiments across multiple visual domains: 2D layouts, Omniglot characters, and 3D shapes. We find that our method outperforms task-specific alternatives, and performs competitively against domain-specific approaches for the limited domains where they exist.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2024,In-context Convergence of Transformers,"Transformers have recently revolutionized many domains in modern machine learning and one salient discovery is their remarkable in-context learning capability, where models can solve an unseen task by utilizing task-specific prompts without further parameters fine-tuning. This also inspired recent theoretical studies aiming to understand the in-context learning mechanism of transformers, which however focused only on *linear* transformers. In this work, we take the first step toward studying the learning dynamics of a one-layer transformer with *softmax* attention trained via gradient descent in order to in-context learn linear function classes. We consider a structured data model, where each token is randomly sampled from a set of feature vectors in either balanced or imbalanced fashion. For data with balanced features, we establish the finite-time convergence guarantee with near-zero prediction error by navigating our analysis over two phases of the training dynamics of the attention map. More notably, for data with imbalanced features, we show that the learning dynamics take a stage-wise convergence process, where the transformer first converges to a near-zero prediction error for the query tokens of dominant features, and then converges later to a near-zero error for query tokens of under-represented features, via one and four training phases. Our proof features new techniques for analyzing the competing strengths of two types of attention weights, the change of which determines different training phases.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2024,Breaking through the learning plateaus of in-context learning in Transformer,"In-context learning, i.e., learning from context examples, is an impressive ability of Transformer. Training Transformers to possess this in-context learning skill is computationally intensive due to the occurrence of *learning plateaus*, which are periods within the training process where there is minimal or no enhancement in the model's in-context learning capability. To study the mechanism behind the learning plateaus, we conceptually separate a component within the model's internal representation that is exclusively affected by the model's weights. We call this the “weights component”, and the remainder is identified as the “context component”. By conducting meticulous and controlled experiments on synthetic tasks, we note that the persistence of learning plateaus correlates with compromised functionality of the weights component. Recognizing the impaired performance of the weights component as a fundamental behavior that drives learning plateaus, we have developed three strategies to expedite the learning of Transformers. The effectiveness of these strategies is further confirmed in natural language processing tasks. In conclusion, our research demonstrates the feasibility of cultivating a powerful in-context learning ability within AI systems in an eco-friendly manner.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Mastering Robot Manipulation with Multimodal Prompts through Pretraining and Multi-task Fine-tuning,"Prompt-based learning has been demonstrated as a compelling paradigm contributing to large language models' tremendous success (LLMs). Inspired by their success in language tasks, existing research has leveraged LLMs in embodied instruction following and task planning. In this work, we tackle the problem of training a robot to understand multimodal prompts, interleaving vision signals with text descriptions. This type of task poses a major challenge to robots' capability to understand the interconnection and complementarity between vision and language signals. In this work, we introduce an effective framework that learns a policy to perform robot manipulation with multimodal prompts from multi-task expert trajectories. Our methods consist of a two-stage training pipeline that performs inverse dynamics pretraining and multi-task finetuning. To facilitate multimodal understanding, we design our multimodal prompt encoder by augmenting a pretrained LM with a residual connection to the visual input and model the dependencies among action dimensions. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of our method on the VIMA-BENCH and establish a new state-of-the-art (10% improvement in success rate). Moreover, we demonstrate that our model exhibits remarkable in-context learning ability.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,Large Language Models Can Automatically Engineer Features for Few-Shot Tabular Learning,"Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable ability to tackle challenging and unseen reasoning problems, hold immense potential for tabular learning, that is vital for many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel in-context learning framework, FeatLLM, which employs LLMs as feature engineers to produce an input data set that is optimally suited for tabular predictions. The generated features are used to infer class likelihood with a simple downstream machine learning model, such as linear regression and yields high performance few-shot learning. The proposed FeatLLM framework only uses this simple predictive model with the discovered features at inference time. Compared to existing LLM-based approaches, FeatLLM eliminates the need to send queries to the LLM for each sample at inference time. Moreover, it merely requires API-level access to LLMs, and overcomes prompt size limitations. As demonstrated across numerous tabular datasets from a wide range of domains, FeatLLM generates high-quality rules, significantly (10% on average) outperforming alternatives such as TabLLM and STUNT.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2024,Machine Vision Therapy: Multimodal Large Language Models Can Enhance Visual Robustness via Denoising In-Context Learning,"Although pre-trained models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) show impressive generalization results, their robustness is still limited under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. Instead of undesirably leveraging human annotation as commonly done, it is possible to leverage the visual understanding power of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, MLLMs struggle with vision problems due to task incompatibility, thus hindering their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs via Machine Vision Therapy which aims to rectify erroneous predictions of specific vision models. By supervising vision models using MLLM predictions, visual robustness can be boosted in a nearly unsupervised manner. Moreover, we propose a Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to solve the incompatibility issue. Concretely, by examining the noise probability of each example through a transition matrix, we construct an instruction containing a correct exemplar and a probable erroneous one, which enables MLLMs to detect and rectify the incorrect predictions of vision models. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically show that our DICL method is guaranteed to find the ground truth. Through extensive experiments on various OOD datasets, our method demonstrates powerful capabilities for enhancing visual robustness under many OOD scenarios.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2024,Learning Cognitive Maps from Transformer Representations for Efficient Planning in Partially Observed Environments,"Despite their stellar performance on a wide range of tasks, including in-context tasks only revealed during inference, vanilla transformers and variants trained for next-token predictions (a) do not learn an explicit world model of their environment which can be flexibly queried and (b) cannot be used for planning or navigation. In this paper, we consider partially observed environments (POEs), where an agent receives perceptually aliased observations as it navigates, which makes path planning hard. We introduce a transformer with (multiple) discrete bottleneck(s), TDB, whose latent codes learn a compressed representation of the history of observations and actions. After training a TDB to predict the future observation(s) given the history, we extract interpretable cognitive maps of the environment from its active bottleneck(s) indices. These maps are then paired with an external solver to solve (constrained) path planning problems. First, we show that a TDB trained on POEs (a) retains the near-perfect predictive performance of a vanilla transformer or an LSTM while (b) solving shortest path problems exponentially faster. Second, a TDB extracts interpretable representations from text datasets, while reaching higher in-context accuracy than vanilla sequence models. Finally, in new POEs, a TDB (a) reaches near-perfect in-context accuracy, (b) learns accurate in-context cognitive maps (c) solves in-context path planning problems.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2024,Subgoal-based Demonstration Learning for Formal Theorem Proving,"Large language models (LLMs) present a promising pathway for advancing the domain of formal theorem proving. In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of LLMs in formal theorem proving by thoroughly examining the structure and organization of demonstrative in-context examples. We introduce a subgoal-based demonstration learning framework, specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of proof search in LLMs. First, drawing upon the insights of subgoal learning from reinforcement learning and robotics, we propose the construction of distinct subgoals for each demonstration example and refine these subgoals in accordance with the pertinent theories of subgoal learning. Second, we build upon recent advances in diffusion models to predict the optimal organization, simultaneously addressing two intricate issues that persist within the domain of demonstration organization: subset selection and order determination. Our integration of subgoal-based learning has notably increased proof accuracy from 38.9% to 44.1% on the miniF2F benchmark. Furthermore, the adoption of diffusion models for demonstration organization can lead to an additional enhancement in accuracy to 45.5%, or a $5\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared to previously established methods.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2024,Unifying Image Processing as Visual Prompting Question Answering,"Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims at enhancing image quality and extracting essential features for subsequent vision applications. Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individual tasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developing large-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigm shift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unified model to deal with various tasks. However, these advances have predominantly concentrated on high-level vision tasks, with less attention paid to low-level vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a universal model for general image processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, image feature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework, named PromptGIP, unifies these diverse image processing tasks within a universal framework. Inspired by NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual prompting question answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image pair as a structured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processing task as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain tasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specific finetuning. Capable of handling up to 15 different image processing tasks, PromptGIP represents a versatile and adaptive approach to general image processing. While PromptGIP has demonstrated a certain degree of out-of-domain task generalization capability, further research is expected to fully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.

ICML,2024,Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models,"Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task.

ICML,2024,Exploring the LLM Journey from Cognition to Expression with Linear Representations,"This paper presents an in-depth examination of the evolution and interplay of cognitive and expressive capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Baichuan-7B and Baichuan-33B, an advanced bilingual (Chinese and English) LLM series. We define and explore the model's cognitive and expressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical phases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and quality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the network, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive capability is defined as the model’s capability to produce word-level output. Our findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities are largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities predominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a significant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive capacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the theoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and their connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate various optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and repeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive capabilities. This research reveals the potential connection between the hidden space and the output space, contributing valuable insights into the interpretability and controllability of their training processes.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2024,Why Larger Language Models Do In-context Learning Differently?,"Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a powerful tool for AI, with the key ability of in-context learning (ICL), where they can perform well on unseen tasks based on a brief series of task examples without necessitating any adjustments to the model parameters. One recent interesting mysterious observation is that models of different scales may have different ICL behaviors: larger models tend to be more sensitive to noise in the test context. This work studies this observation theoretically aiming to improve the understanding of LLM and ICL. We analyze two stylized settings: (1) linear regression with one-layer single-head linear transformers and (2) parity classification with two-layer multiple attention heads transformers (non-linear data and non-linear model). In both settings, we give closed-form optimal solutions and find that smaller models emphasize important hidden features while larger ones cover more hidden features; thus, smaller models are more robust to noise while larger ones are more easily distracted, leading to different ICL behaviors. This sheds light on where transformers pay attention to and how that affects ICL. Preliminary experimental results on large base and chat models provide positive support for our analysis.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全

We therefore propose CDTD, or Causal Domain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for knowledge transfer. To identify the temporally invariant and variant representations, we employ the causal representation learning methods for unsupervised pertaining, and then tune the classifier with supervisions in next stage. Specifically, we assume the domain information can be well estimated and the pre-trained temporal dynamic generation and transition models can be well transferred. During adaptation, we fix the transferable temporal dynamics and update the image encoder and domain estimator. The efficacy of our approach is revealed by the superior accuracy of CDTD over leading alternatives across standard few-shot action recognition datasets.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2024,MVMoE: Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver with Mixture-of-Experts,"Learning to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has garnered much attention. However, most neural solvers are only structured and trained independently on a specific problem, making them less generic and practical. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified neural solver that can cope with a range of VRP variants simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. We further develop a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity. Experimentally, our method significantly promotes zero-shot generalization performance on 10 unseen VRP variants, and showcases decent results on the few-shot setting and real-world benchmark instances.

ICML,2025,Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection,"Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,An Empirical Study on Configuring In-Context Learning Demonstrations for Unleashing MLLMs' Sentimental Perception Capability,"The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability. Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval, presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized. A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL baseline.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Measuring In-Context Computation Complexity via Hidden State Prediction,"Detecting when a neural sequence model does ""interesting"" computation is an open problem. The next token prediction loss is a poor indicator: Low loss can stem from trivially predictable sequences that are uninteresting, while high loss may reflect unpredictable but also irrelevant information that can be ignored by the model. We propose a better metric: measuring the model's ability to predict its own future hidden states. We show empirically that this metric–in contrast to the next token prediction loss–correlates with the intuitive interestingness of the task. To measure predictability, we introduce the architecture-agnostic ""prediction of hidden states"" (PHi) layer that serves as an information bottleneck on the main pathway of the network (e.g., the residual stream in Transformers). We propose a novel learned predictive prior that enables us to measure the novel information gained in each computation step, which serves as our metric. We show empirically that our metric predicts the description length of formal languages learned in-context, the complexity of mathematical reasoning problems, and the correctness of self-generated reasoning chains.",📊 评测基准与数据集

Aimed at bridging the solution length gap between CoT and AoT, this paper introduces AoT-O3, which combines supervised finetuning on AoT-style plans with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to reduce solution length. The RL component uses a reward model that favors concise, valid solutions  while maintaining planning accuracy.

ICML,2025,Nonlinear transformers can perform inference-time feature learning,"Pretrained transformers have demonstrated the ability to implement various algorithms at inference time without parameter updates. While theoretical works have established this capability through constructions and approximation guarantees, the optimization and statistical efficiency aspects remain understudied. In this work, we investigate how transformers learn features in-context -- a key mechanism underlying their inference-time adaptivity. We focus on the in-context learning of single-index models $y=\sigma_*(\langle \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\beta}\rangle)$, which are low-dimensional nonlinear functions parameterized by feature vector $\\boldsymbol\beta$. We prove that transformers pretrained by gradient-based optimization can perform *inference-time feature learning*, i.e., extract information of the target features $\\boldsymbol{\beta}$ solely from test prompts (despite $\\boldsymbol
{\beta}$ varying across different prompts), hence achieving an in-context statistical efficiency that surpasses any non-adaptive (fixed-basis) algorithms such as kernel methods. Moreover, we show that the inference-time sample complexity surpasses the Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound, owing to nonlinear label transformations naturally induced by the Softmax self-attention mechanism.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性

We investigate the effectiveness of test-time training (TTT)—temporarily updating model parameters during inference using a loss derived from input data—as a mechanism for improving LMs' reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), performing TTT with in-context examples yields up to $6\times$ higher accuracy compared to fine-tuned baselines—reaching $53.0\%$ on the public validation set with an 8B-parameter LM and $61.9\%$ when ensembled with program-synthesis methods, matching average human performance. On BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), TTT on in-context examples surpasses standard few-shot prompting in the $10$-shot setting by $7.3$ percentage points ($50.5\%$ to $57.8\%$).

ICML,2025,Provable In-Context Vector Arithmetic via Retrieving Task Concepts,"In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations.

Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward, we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded *hierarchical* concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic.

ICML,2025,COGNATE: Acceleration of Sparse Tensor Programs on Emerging Hardware using Transfer Learning,"Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics, driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware.

ICML,2025,GuardAgent: Safeguard LLM Agents via Knowledge-Enabled Reasoning,"The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) agents has raised new concerns regarding their safety and security. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83%

ICML,2025,Addressing Imbalanced Domain-Incremental Learning through Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts,"Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class distribution shifts.  These challenges significantly hinder model performance, as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts (DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance. Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate DCE’s state-of-the-art performance.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2025,In-Context Linear Regression Demystified: Training Dynamics and Mechanistic Interpretability of Multi-Head Softmax Attention,"We study how multi-head softmax attention models are trained to perform in-context learning on linear data. 
Through extensive empirical experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query weights, and a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value weights. 
Remarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training starting from random initialization. 
Our analysis reveals that such emergent structures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased gradient descent predictor --- one that outperforms single-head attention and nearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor.  
We also extend our study to scenarios with anisotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. 
Our results reveal that in-context learning ability emerges from the trained transformer as an aggregated effect of its architecture and the underlying data distribution, paving the way for deeper understanding and broader applications of in-context learning.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Federated In-Context Learning: Iterative Refinement for Improved Answer Quality,"For question-answering (QA) tasks, in-context learning (ICL) enables language models (LMs) to generate responses without modifying their parameters by leveraging examples provided in the input. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the availability of high-quality examples, which are often scarce due to data privacy constraints, annotation costs, and distribution disparities. A natural solution is to utilize examples stored on client devices, but existing approaches either require transmitting model parameters—incurring significant communication overhead—or fail to fully exploit local datasets, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Federated In-Context Learning (Fed-ICL), a general framework that enhances ICL through an iterative, collaborative process. Fed-ICL progressively refines responses by leveraging multi-round interactions between clients and a central server, improving answer quality without the need to transmit model parameters. We establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Fed-ICL and conduct extensive experiments on standard QA benchmarks, demonstrating that our proposed approach achieves strong performance while maintaining low communication costs.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,Graph World Model,"World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation, and planning tasks.
Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data while cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed, they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on 6 tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching, recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation, and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and demonstrate strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.

ICML,2025,Test-Time Training Provably Improves Transformers as In-context Learners,"Test-time training (TTT) methods explicitly update the weights of a model to adapt to the specific test instance, and they have found success in a variety of settings, including most recently language modeling and reasoning. To demystify this success, we investigate a gradient-based TTT algorithm for in-context learning, where we train a transformer model on the in-context demonstrations provided in the test prompt. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive theoretical characterization of linear transformers when the update rule is a single gradient step. Our theory (i) delineates the role of alignment between pretraining distribution and target task, (ii) demystifies how TTT can alleviate distribution shift, and (iii) quantifies the sample complexity of TTT including how it can significantly reduce the eventual sample size required for in-context learning. As our empirical contribution, we study the benefits of TTT for TabPFN, a tabular foundation model. In line with our theory, we demonstrate that TTT significantly reduces the required sample size for tabular classification (3 to 5 times fewer) unlocking substantial inference efficiency with a negligible training cost.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2025,(How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?,"Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \\;\mathrm{mod}\\; m$. We find that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). By analyzing the embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we investigate how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus; and demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. 
We find that models learn to factorize $m$ and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $d= 3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,MAPLE: Many-Shot Adaptive Pseudo-Labeling for In-Context Learning,"In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples. However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose **M**any-Shot **A**daptive **P**seudo-**L**ab**E**ling, namely **MAPLE**, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of label information. 
We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling costs.

ICML,2025,When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?,"In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,"PANDAS: Improving Many-shot Jailbreaking via Positive Affirmation, Negative Demonstration, and Adaptive Sampling","Many-shot jailbreaking circumvents the safety alignment of LLMs by exploiting their ability to process long input sequences. To achieve this, the malicious target prompt is prefixed with hundreds of fabricated conversational exchanges between the user and the model. These exchanges are randomly sampled from a pool of unsafe question-answer pairs, making it appear as though the model has already complied with harmful instructions. In this paper, we present PANDAS: a hybrid technique that improves many-shot jailbreaking by modifying these fabricated dialogues with Positive Affirmations, Negative Demonstrations, and an optimized Adaptive Sampling method tailored to the target prompt's topic. We also introduce ManyHarm, a dataset of harmful question–answer pairs, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that PANDAS significantly outperforms baseline methods in long-context scenarios.

ICML,2025,PENCIL: Long Thoughts with Short Memory,"While state-of-the-art LLMs have demonstrated great promise of using long Chains-of-Thought (CoT) to boost reasoning, scaling it up to more challenging problems is fundamentally limited by suboptimal memory usage — intermediate computations accumulate indefinitely in context even no longer needed for future thoughts. We introduce PENCIL, which incorporates a novel reduction mechanism into the autoregressive generation process that recursively clean up intermediate thoughts based on patterns learned from training. By alternately generating and erasing, PENCIL can think deeper to solve harder problems using shorter context and less computes. Empirically, for example, we demonstrate PENCIL with a small 25M-parameter transformer and 2048 context length solves Einstein's puzzle — a task that challenges much larger models like GPT-4. Theoretically, we prove PENCIL can perform universal efficient computation by simulating any Turing machines with optimal time and space complexity, and thus can solve arbitrary computable tasks that are otherwise intractable for vanilla CoT.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2025,MATH-Perturb: Benchmarking LLMs' Math Reasoning Abilities against Hard Perturbations,"Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, which has triggered the discussion of whether the performance is achieved by true reasoning capability or memorization. To investigate this question, prior work has constructed mathematical benchmarks when questions undergo simple perturbations -- modifications that still preserve the underlying reasoning patterns of the solutions. However, no work has explored hard perturbations, which fundamentally change the nature of the problem so that the original solution steps do not apply. To bridge the gap, we construct MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard via simple perturbation and hard perturbation, respectively. Each consists of 279 perturbed math problems derived from level-5 (hardest) problems in the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021). We observe significant performance drops on  MATH-P-Hard across various models, including o1-mini (-16.49%) and gemini-2.0-flash-thinking (-12.9%). We also raise concerns about a novel form of memorization where models blindly apply learned problem-solving skills without assessing their applicability to modified contexts. This issue is amplified when using original problems for in-context learning. We call for research efforts to address this challenge, which is critical for developing more robust and reliable reasoning models.

By training on synthetic interaction data from different tasks that require diverse strategies, Paprika teaches models to explore and adapt their behavior on a new task based on environment feedback in-context without more gradient updates. Experimental results show that models fine-tuned with Paprika can effectively transfer their learned decision-making capabilities to entirely unseen tasks without additional training. Unlike traditional training, our approach's primary bottleneck lies in sampling useful interaction data instead of model updates. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes sampling trajectories from tasks with high learning potential.

ICML,2025,Which Attention Heads Matter for In-Context Learning?,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capability, enabling them to generate relevant responses from a handful of task demonstrations in the prompt. 
Prior studies have suggested two different explanations for the mechanisms behind ICL:
induction heads that find and copy relevant tokens, and function vector (FV) heads whose activations compute a latent encoding of the ICL task.
To better understand which of the two distinct mechanisms drives ICL, we study and compare induction heads and FV heads in 12 language models. Through detailed ablations, we find that few-shot ICL is driven primarily by FV heads, especially in larger models. We also find that FV and induction heads are connected: many FV heads
start as induction heads during training before transitioning to the FV mechanism. This leads us to speculate that induction facilitates learning the more complex FV mechanism for ICL.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,TabICL: A Tabular Foundation Model for In-Context Learning on Large Data,"The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees on tabular data is currently challenged by tabular foundation models using In-Context Learning (ICL): setting the training data as context for the test data and predicting in a single forward pass without parameter updates. While TabPFNv2 foundation model excels on tables with up to 10K samples, its alternating column- and row-wise attentions make handling large training sets computationally prohibitive. So, can ICL be effectively scaled and deliver a benefit for larger tables? We introduce TabICL, a tabular foundation model for classification, pretrained on synthetic datasets with up to 60K samples and capable of handling 500K samples on affordable resources. This is enabled by a novel two-stage architecture: a column-then-row attention mechanism to build fixed-dimensional embeddings of rows, followed by a transformer for efficient ICL. Across 200 classification datasets from the TALENT benchmark, TabICL is on par with TabPFNv2 while being systematically faster (up to 10 times), and significantly outperforms all other approaches. On 53 datasets with over 10K samples, TabICL surpasses both TabPFNv2 and CatBoost, demonstrating the potential of ICL for large data.

Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time.  We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, and other time series foundation models.  Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even matches the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In *external search*, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external game engine, and in *internal search*, the model is trained to generate in-context a linearized tree of search and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, reliably capturing the transition and value functions in the respective environments, with minimal hallucinations. We evaluate our LLM search implementations against game-specific state-of-the-art engines, showcasing substantial improvements in strength over the base model, and reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating closer to the human search budget.

ICML,2025,Large Language Models are Demonstration Pre-Selectors for Themselves,"In-context learning with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire training dataset. However, previous few-shot in-context learning methods, which calculate similarity scores for choosing demonstrations, incur high computational costs by repeatedly retrieving large-scale datasets for each query. This is due to their failure to recognize that not all demonstrations are equally informative, and many less informative demonstrations can be inferred from a core set of highly informative ones. To this end, we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel \emph{pre-selection} framework that identifies a core subset of demonstrations containing the most informative examples. This subset, referred to as the FEEDER set, consists of demonstrations that capture both the ''sufficiency'' and ''necessity'' information to infer the entire dataset. Notice that FEEDER is selected before the few-shot in-context learning, enabling more efficient few-shot demonstrations choosing in a smaller set. To identify FEEDER, we propose a novel effective tree based algorithm. Once selected, it can replace the original dataset, leading to improved efficiency and prediction accuracy in few-shot in-context learning. Additionally, FEEDER also benefit fine-tuning LLMs, we propose a bi-level optimization method enabling more efficient training without sacrificing performance when datasets become smaller. Our experiments are on 6 text classification datasets, 1 reasoning dataset, and 1 semantic-parsing dataset, across 6 LLMs (ranging from 335M to 7B parameters), demonstrate that: (i) In few-shot inference, FEEDER achieves superior (or comparable) performance while utilizing only half the input training data.

In this paper, we present a framework for automatically generating a comprehensive set of tests to evaluate models' abilities to use their memory effectively. Our framework extends the range of capability tests beyond the commonly explored (passkey, key-value, needle in the haystack) search, a dominant focus in the literature. Specifically, we evaluate models on atomic tasks such as searching, recalling, editing, matching, comparing information in context memory, performing basic operations when inputs are structured into distinct blocks, and maintaining state while operating on memory, simulating real-world data.

In practice, however, evaluation is performed on a small set of fixed, canonical test sets, which are carefully curated to measure the capabilities of interest and are not changed frequently.

However, accurate range estimates are only available for a relatively small proportion of all known species. For the majority of the remaining species, we typically only have a small number of records denoting the spatial locations where they have previously been observed. We outline a new approach for few-shot species range estimation to address the challenge of accurately estimating the range of a species from limited data. During inference, our model takes a set of spatial locations as input, along with optional metadata such as text or an image, and outputs a species encoding that can be used to predict the range of a previously unseen species in a feedforward manner.

This setting is a gradient-based analog of usual in-context learning (ICL) and appears in some recent works.

Using a multi-step reasoning task, we prove in a simplified setting that context-enhanced learning can be **exponentially more sample-efficient** than standard learning when the model is capable of ICL. At a mechanistic level, we find that the benefit of context-enhancement arises from a more accurate gradient learning signal.

ICML,2025,Aligning LLMs by Predicting Preferences from User Writing Samples,"Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e., Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%.

However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency often hinder their direct application for predictive tasks where privacy and interpretability are paramount. In fields such as healthcare, biology, and finance, specialised and interpretable linear models still hold considerable value. In such domains, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Well-specified prior distributions over model parameters can reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference; however, eliciting expert priors can be time-consuming. We therefore introduce AutoElicit to extract knowledge from LLMs and construct priors for predictive models. We show these priors are informative and can be refined using natural language. We perform a careful study contrasting AutoElicit with in-context learning and demonstrate how to perform model selection between the two methods. We find that AutoElicit yields priors that can substantially reduce error over uninformative priors, using fewer labels, and consistently outperform in-context learning.

ICML,2025,Beyond Induction Heads: In-Context Meta Learning Induces Multi-Phase Circuit Emergence,"Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where predictions are made adaptively based on context. 
While prior work links induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account for ICL when the answer is included within the context.
However, an important property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context; how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored.
In this paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. 
Specifically, we extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries.
Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads.

By leveraging in-context information during both pre-training and inference, Zebra dynamically adapts to new tasks by conditioning on input sequences that incorporate context example trajectories. As a generative model, Zebra can be used to generate new trajectories and allows quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. We evaluate Zebra across a variety of challenging PDE scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability, robustness, and superior performance compared to existing approaches.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,PCEvolve: Private Contrastive Evolution for Synthetic Dataset Generation via Few-Shot Private Data and Generative APIs,"The rise of generative APIs has fueled interest in privacy-preserving synthetic data generation. While the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm generates Differential Privacy (DP) synthetic images using diffusion model APIs, it struggles with few-shot private data due to the limitations of its DP-protected similarity voting approach. In practice, the few-shot private data challenge is particularly prevalent in specialized domains like healthcare and industry. To address this challenge, we propose a novel API-assisted algorithm, Private Contrastive Evolution (PCEvolve), which iteratively mines inherent inter-class contrastive relationships in few-shot private data beyond individual data points and seamlessly integrates them into an adapted Exponential Mechanism (EM) to optimize DP’s utility in an evolution loop. We conduct extensive experiments on four specialized datasets, demonstrating that PCEvolve outperforms PE and other API-assisted baselines. These results highlight the potential of leveraging API access with private data for quality evaluation, enabling the generation of high-quality DP synthetic images and paving the way for more accessible and effective privacy-preserving generative API applications.

ICML,2025,Bootstrapping Self-Improvement of Language Model Programs for Zero-Shot Schema Matching,"Schema matching -- the task of finding matches between attributes across disparate data sources with different tables and hierarchies -- is critical for creating interoperable machine learning (ML)-ready data. Addressing this fundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains like healthcare, finance and e-commerce --- but also has the potential to benefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model training. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to structural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas. Previous ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required significant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or suffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker -  a compositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of candidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also self-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations via a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context demonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process.  Empirically, we demonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker outperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to accelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2025,World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents,"In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the framework’s potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2025,Revisiting Neural Networks for Few-Shot Learning: A Zero-Cost NAS Perspective,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has recently outperformed hand-designed networks in various artificial intelligence areas. However, previous works only target a pre-defined task. For a new task in few-shot learning (FSL) scenarios, the architecture is either searched from scratch, which is neither efficient nor flexible, or borrowed architecture from the ones obtained on other tasks, which may lead to sub-optimal. Can we select the best neural architectures without involving any training and eliminate a significant portion of the search cost for new tasks in FSL? In this work, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing a novel information bottleneck (IB) theory driven \textit{Few-shot Neural Architecture Search} (dubbed, IBFS) framework to address this issue. We first derive that the global convergence of Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) can be guaranteed by only considering the first-order loss landscape. Moreover, motivated by the observation that IB provides a unified view toward understanding machine learning models, we propose a novel Zero-Cost method tailored for FSL to rank and select architectures based on their \textit{expressivity} obtained by IB mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that IBFS achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSL without training, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our IBFS.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,TabPFN Unleashed: A Scalable and Effective Solution to Tabular Classification Problems,"TabPFN has emerged as a promising in-context learning model for tabular data, capable of directly predicting the labels of test samples given labeled training examples. It has demonstrated competitive performance, particularly on small-scale classification tasks. However, despite its effectiveness, TabPFN still requires further refinement in several areas, including handling high-dimensional features, aligning with downstream datasets, and scaling to larger datasets.
In this paper, we revisit existing variants of TabPFN and observe that most approaches focus either on reducing bias or variance, often neglecting the need to address the other side, while also increasing inference overhead. To fill this gap, we propose  Beta (**B**agging and **E**ncoder-based Fine-tuning for **T**abPFN **A**daptation), a novel and effective method designed to *minimize both bias and variance*. To reduce bias, we introduce a lightweight encoder to better align downstream tasks with the pre-trained TabPFN. By increasing the number of encoders in a lightweight manner, Beta mitigates variance, thereby further improving the model’s performance. Additionally, bootstrapped sampling is employed to further  reduce the impact of data perturbations on the model, all while maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Our approach enhances TabPFN’s ability to handle high-dimensional data and scale to larger datasets. Experimental results on over 200 benchmark classification datasets demonstrate that Beta either outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,ReinboT: Amplifying Robot Visual-Language Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great potential in general robotic decision-making tasks via imitation learning. However, the variable quality of training data often constrains the performance of these models. On the other hand, offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at learning robust policy models from mixed-quality data. In this paper, we introduce Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end VLA model that integrates the RL principle of maximizing cumulative reward. ReinboT achieves a deeper understanding of the data quality distribution by predicting dense returns that capture the nuances of manipulation tasks. The dense return prediction capability enables the robot to generate more robust decision-making actions, oriented towards maximizing future benefits. Extensive experiments show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset and exhibits superior few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,The Missing Alignment Link of In-context Learning on Sequences,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to perform in-context learning (ICL) for completely unseen tasks in classification or language completion.  Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) is another popular task category with several applications seeking quick adaptation with ICL. We present a systematic analysis of the ICL capability of LLMs on Seq2Seq tasks using a formal structured language-pair. Our study reveals a critical limitation: except for very short input sequences, ICL fails to achieve consistent learning across all output positions. This exposes a fundamental weakness of modern LLMs — their inability to effectively uncover the alignment between input and output sequences. Consequently, this limitation results in incomplete induction heads, which are essential for in-context learning of new discrete mappings.

To address these limitations, we propose ICA-Tune, a method for focused fine-tuning of an LLM using in-context examples. We present a mechanistic evaluation with two accuracy probes to show how input-output alignment emerges in middle layers of an LLM without direct supervision. This alignment leads to an abrupt jump in the completeness of  the induction heads in higher layers. We show that, compared to standard fine-tuning, ICA-Tune enables more sample efficient learning and better generalization to OOD instances.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,What Makes In-context Learning Effective for Mathematical Reasoning,"Owing to the capability of in-context learning, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks. However, we find that few-shot demonstrations can sometimes bring negative performance and their effectiveness on LLMs' reasoning abilities remains unreliable. To this end, in this paper, we aim to theoretically analyze the impact of in-context demonstrations on LLMs' reasoning performance. We prove that the reasoning efficacy (measured by empirical prediction loss) can be bounded by an \emph{LLM-oriented semantic similarity} and an \emph{inference stability of demonstrations}, which is general for both one-shot and few-shot scenarios. Based on this finding, we propose a straightforward, generalizable, and low-complexity demonstration selection method named LMS3. It facilitates to select the most pertinent samples for different LLMs and includes a novel demonstration rejection mechanism to automatically filter out samples that are unsuitable for few-shot learning. Through experiments on three representative benchmarks, two LLM backbones, and multiple few-shot settings, we verify that our LMS3 has superiority and achieves consistent improvements on all datasets, which existing methods have been unable to accomplish.

ICML,2025,NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching,"Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a ""needle"" (relevant information) from a ""haystack"" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. 
To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 13 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 11 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information. 
Even models enhanced with reasoning capabilities or CoT prompting struggle to maintain performance in long contexts.

ICML,2025,In-Context Denoising with One-Layer Transformers: Connections between Attention and Associative Memory Retrieval,"We introduce in-context denoising, a task that refines the connection between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, also known as modern Hopfield networks. Using a Bayesian framework, we show theoretically and empirically that certain restricted denoising problems can be solved optimally even by a single-layer transformer. We demonstrate that a trained attention layer processes each denoising prompt by performing a single gradient descent update on a context-aware DAM energy landscape, where context tokens serve as associative memories and the query token acts as an initial state. This one-step update yields better solutions than exact retrieval of either a context token or a spurious local minimum, providing a concrete example of DAM networks extending beyond the standard retrieval paradigm. Overall, this work solidifies the link between associative memory and attention mechanisms first identified by Ramsauer et al., and demonstrates the relevance of associative memory models in the study of in-context learning.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Task Generalization with Autoregressive Compositional Structure: Can Learning from $D$ Tasks Generalize to $D^T$ Tasks?,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable task generalization, solving tasks they were never explicitly trained on with only a few demonstrations. This raises a fundamental question: When can learning from a small set of tasks  generalize to a large task family? In this paper, we investigate task generalization through the lens of autoregressive compositional structure, where each task is a composition of T operations, and each operation is among a finite family of D subtasks. This yields a total class of size~D^T. We first show that generalization to all D^T  tasks is theoretically achievable by training on only \tilde{O}(D) tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that Transformers achieve such exponential task generalization on sparse parity functions via In-context Learning (ICL) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further demonstrate this exponential generalization in arithmetic and language translation, extending beyond parity functions.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2025,Sample Efficient Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning,"The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE (Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of “challenger” arms, which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of the arms from this shortlist or the current top-m set is pulled, thereby reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations. Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7× speedup in runtime while requiring 7× fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods.

ICML,2025,Self-Disentanglement and Re-Composition for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation,"Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited annotated samples. Current methods typically compare the distance between training and testing samples for mask prediction. However, a problem of feature entanglement exists in this well-adopted method, which binds multiple patterns together and harms the transferability. However, we find an entanglement problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind source-domain patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both the generalization and finetuning. 		Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,Adapter Naturally Serves as Decoupler for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to first pre-train the model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the model to target-domain datasets where only a few training samples are available for efficient finetuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the domain gap and (2) finetuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler. Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and we find the model's inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information. Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN), which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to learn knowledge specific to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly by 2.69% and 4.68% average MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,Self-cross Feature based Spiking Neural Networks for Efficient Few-shot Learning,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel in computer vision tasks, especially,  few-shot learning (FSL), which is increasingly important for generalizing from limited examples. However, DNNs are computationally expensive with scalability issues in real world. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven nature and low energy consumption, are particularly efficient in processing sparse and dynamic data, though they still encounter difficulties in capturing complex spatiotemporal features and performing accurate cross-class comparisons. To further enhance the performance and efficiency of SNNs in few-shot learning, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on SNNs, which combines a self-feature extractor module and a cross-feature contrastive module to refine feature representation and reduce power consumption. We apply the combination of temporal efficient training loss and InfoNCE loss to optimize the temporal dynamics of spike trains and enhance the discriminative power. Experimental results show that the proposed FSL-SNN significantly improves the classification performance on the neuromorphic dataset N-Omniglot, and also achieves competitive performance to ANNs on static datasets such as CUB and miniImageNet with low power consumption.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,In-Context Reinforcement Learning From Suboptimal Historical Data,"Transformer models have achieved remarkable empirical successes, largely due to their in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the *Decision Importance Transformer* (DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.",📊 评测基准与数据集

This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the ground truth distribution of the labels. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,EVOLvE: Evaluating and Optimizing LLMs For In-Context Exploration,"Despite their success in many domains, large language models (LLMs) remain under-studied in scenarios requiring optimal decision-making under uncertainty. This is crucial as many real-world applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to healthcare interventions, demand that LLMs not only predict but also actively learn to make optimal decisions through exploration. In this work, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a state-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We develop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and contextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs' performance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we propose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by providing explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through algorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using synthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques allow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models, surpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation study to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data representation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the LLM's exploration efficiency using the concept of regret, linking its ability to explore to the model size and underlying algorithm.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Proxy-FDA: Proxy-based Feature Distribution Alignment for Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models without Forgetting,"Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often leads to the issue of *concept forgetting* on other tasks. Recent methods of robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose a novel regularization method **Proxy-FDA** that explicitly preserves the structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end, few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image classification, captioning and VQA.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2025,Fast Exact Unlearning for In-Context Learning Data for LLMs,"Modern machine learning models are expensive to train, and there is a growing concern about the challenge of retroactively removing specific training data. Achieving exact unlearning in deep learning pipelines—producing models as if certain data had never been included in training—remains an open problem. In this paper, we revisit exact unlearning in deep learning and show that for large language models (LLMs) we can efficiently exactly unlearn ``fine-tuning data"" (the data used to adapt a pre-trained model). This follows from two observations. First, we can use in-context learning to adapt the LLM to the fine-tuning dataset instead of SGD based algorithms. Second, we show that accurate in-context learning can be done with quantized k-means, which allows for effectively constant time unlearning operations. Our evaluation shows that this unlearning recipe has similar performance to fine-tuning alternatives, but vastly reduces the unlearning costs. Our study also highlights the need for new measures of unlearning cost when adapting the learning algorithm to have faster unlearn operations.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Scaling Sparse Feature Circuits For Studying In-Context Learning,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular tool for interpreting large language model activations, but their utility in addressing open questions in interpretability remains unclear.

to deepen our understanding of the mechanism behind in-context learning (ICL). We identify abstract SAE features that (i) encode the model’s knowledge of which task to execute and (ii) whose latent vectors causally induce the task zero-shot.
This aligns with prior work showing that ICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors are well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these task-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we scale the sparse feature circuits methodology of Marks et al. (2024) to the Gemma 1 2B model for the more complex task of ICL. Through circuit finding, we discover task-detecting features with corresponding SAE latents that activate earlier in the prompt, that detect when tasks have been performed.

ICML,2025,Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees,"Foundation models are pretrained on large-scale corpora to learn generalizable patterns across domains and tasks---such as contours, textures, and edges in images, or tokens and sentences in text. In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization.

ICML,2025,Does learning the right latent variables necessarily improve in-context learning?,"Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for efficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the data factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates the data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this factorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers implicitly do so or instead exploit heuristics and statistical shortcuts through attention layers. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of explicitly inferring task latents by minimally modifying the Transformer architecture with a bottleneck to prevent shortcuts and incentivize structured solutions. We compare it against standard Transformers across various ICL tasks and find that contrary to intuition and recent works, there is little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards task-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution performance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck effectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream processing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study highlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured ICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents aids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,In-Context Learning and Occam's Razor,"A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best—a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning—an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved.

ICML,2025,Behavioral Exploration: Learning to Explore via In-Context Adaptation,"Developing autonomous agents that quickly explore an environment and adapt their behavior online is a canonical challenge in robotics and machine learning. While humans are able to achieve such fast online exploration and adaptation, often acquiring new information and skills in only a handful of interactions, existing algorithmic approaches tend to rely on random exploration and slow, gradient-based behavior updates. How can we endow autonomous agents with such capabilities on par with humans? Taking inspiration from recent progress on both in-context learning and large-scale behavioral cloning, in this work we propose behavioral exploration: training agents to internalize what it means to explore and adapt in-context over the space of ''expert'' behaviors. To achieve this, given access to a dataset of expert demonstrations, we train a long-context generative model to predict expert actions conditioned on a context of past observations and a measure of how ''exploratory'' the expert's behaviors are relative to this context. This enables the model to not only mimic the behavior of an expert, but also, by feeding its past history of interactions into its context, to select different expert behaviors than what have been previously selected, thereby allowing for fast online adaptation and targeted, ''expert-like'' exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated locomotion and manipulation settings, as well as on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, illustrating its ability to learn adaptive, exploratory behavior.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Emergence and Effectiveness of Task Vectors in In-Context Learning: An Encoder Decoder Perspective,"Autoregressive transformers exhibit adaptive learning through in-context learning (ICL), which begs the question of how. Prior works have shown that transformers represent the ICL tasks as vectors in their representations. In this paper, we leverage the encoding-decoding framework to study how transformers form task vectors during pretraining and how their task encoding quality predicts ICL task performance. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of task encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent tasks (e.g., ""Finding the first noun in a sentence."") into distinct, separable representations, it concurrently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improves its ICL performance. We validate this phenomenon across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B) and over the course of pretraining in OLMo-7B. Further, we demonstrate that the quality of task encoding  inferred from representations predicts ICL performance, and that, surprisingly, finetuning the earlier layers can improve the task encoding and performance more than finetuning the latter layers. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,Learning Policy Committees for Effective Personalization in MDPs with Diverse Tasks,"Many dynamic decision problems, such as robotic control, involve a series of tasks, many of which are unknown at training time.
Typical approaches for these problems, such as multi-task and meta reinforcement learning, do not generalize well when the tasks are diverse. On the other hand, approaches that aim to tackle task diversity, such as using task embedding as policy context and task clustering, typically lack performance guarantees and require a large number of training tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for learning a policy committee that includes at least one near-optimal policy with high probability for tasks encountered during execution. While we show that this problem is in general inapproximable, we present two practical algorithmic solutions.
The first yields provable approximation and task sample complexity guarantees when tasks are low-dimensional (the best we can do due to inapproximability), whereas the second is a general and practical gradient-based approach. In addition, we provide a provable sample complexity bound for few-shot learning.

ICML,2025,Everything Everywhere All at Once: LLMs can In-Context Learn Multiple Tasks in Superposition,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this study, we explore a surprising phenomenon related to ICL: LLMs can perform multiple, computationally distinct ICL tasks simultaneously, during a single inference call, a capability we term task superposition"". We provide empirical evidence of this phenomenon across various LLM families and scales and show that this phenomenon emerges even if we train the model to in-context learn one task at a time. We offer theoretical explanations that this capability is well within the expressive power of transformers. We also explore how LLMs internally compose task vectors during superposition. Furthermore, we show that larger models can solve more ICL tasks in parallel, and better calibrate their output distribution. Our findings offer insights into the latent capabilities of LLMs, further substantiate the perspective of ""LLMs as superposition of simulators"", and raise questions about the mechanisms enabling simultaneous task execution.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,Simplicity Bias and Optimization Threshold in Two-Layer ReLU Networks,"Understanding generalization of overparametrized models remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. The literature mostly studies generalization from an interpolation point of view, taking convergence towards a global minimum of the training loss for granted.  This interpolation paradigm does not seem valid for complex tasks such as in-context learning or diffusion. It has instead been empirically observed that the trained models go from global minima to spurious local minima of the training loss as the number of training samples becomes larger than some level we call optimization threshold. This paper explores theoretically this phenomenon in the context of two-layer ReLU networks. We demonstrate that, despite overparametrization, networks might converge towards simpler solutions rather than interpolating training data, which leads to a drastic improvement on the test loss. Our analysis relies on the so called early alignment phase, during which neurons align toward specific directions. This directional alignment leads to a simplicity bias, wherein the network approximates the ground truth model without converging to the global minimum of the training loss. Our results suggest this bias, resulting in an optimization threshold from which interpolation is not reached anymore, is beneficial and enhances the generalization of trained models.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Hyperband-based Bayesian Optimization for Black-box Prompt Selection,"Optimal prompt selection is crucial for maximizing large language model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks, especially in black-box settings where models are only accessible via APIs.
Black-box prompt selection is challenging due to potentially large, combinatorial search spaces, absence of gradient information, and high evaluation cost of prompts on a validation set.
We propose HbBoPs, a novel method that combines a structural-aware deep kernel Gaussian Process with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler to efficiently select prompts.
HbBoPs uses embeddings of instructions and few-shot exemplars, treating them as modular components within prompts.
This enhances the surrogate model's ability to predict which prompt to evaluate next in a sample-efficient manner.
Hyperband improves query-efficiency by adaptively allocating resources across different fidelity levels, reducing the number of validation instances required for evaluating prompts.
Extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks and three LLMs demonstrate that HbBoPs outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency.",🧺 其他/未归类

Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More importantly, *our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability*. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic data.

ICML,2025,Leveraging Model Guidance to Extract Training Data from Personalized Diffusion Models,"Diffusion Models (DMs) have evolved into advanced image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small set of images to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the potential risks of data leakage by releasing their fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning.  In this paper, we ask: ""Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?"" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data.  Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution---from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets such as WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting approximately 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases, significantly surpassing baseline performance.

Our work enhances the efficiency and scalability of TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model, TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance, TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5 seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a 2× speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5× speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25 tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.

In particular, we focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss, and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams, characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Towards a General Time Series Forecasting Model with Unified Representation and Adaptive Transfer,"With the growing availability of multi-domain time series data, there is an increasing demand for general forecasting models pre-trained on multi-source datasets to support diverse downstream prediction scenarios. Existing time series foundation models primarily focus on scaling up pre-training datasets and model sizes to enhance generalization performance.  In this paper, we take a different approach by addressing two critical aspects of general forecasting models: (1) how to derive unified representations from heterogeneous multi-domain time series data, and (2) how to effectively capture domain-specific features to enable adaptive transfer across various downstream scenarios. To address the first aspect, we propose Decomposed Frequency Learning as the pre-training task, which leverages frequency-based masking and reconstruction to decompose coupled semantic information in time series, resulting in unified representations across domains. For the second aspect, we introduce the Time Series Register, which captures domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances adaptive transferability to downstream tasks. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance on seven real-world benchmarks, demonstrating remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构

ICML,2025,Geometric Feature Embedding for Effective 3D Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning,"3D few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to learn new point cloud categories from limited samples while preventing the forgetting of previously learned categories. This research area significantly enhances the capabilities of self-driving vehicles and computer vision systems. Existing 3D FSCIL approaches primarily utilize multimodal pre-trained models to extract the semantic features, heavily dependent on meticulously designed high-quality prompts and fine-tuning strategies. To reduce this dependence, this paper proposes a novel method for **3D** **F**SCI**L** with **E**mbedded **G**eometric features (**3D-FLEG**). Specifically, 3D-FLEG develops a point cloud *geometric feature extraction module* to capture category-related geometric characteristics. To address the modality heterogeneity issues that arise from integrating geometric and text features, 3D-FLEG introduces a *geometric feature embedding module*. By augmenting text prompts with spatial geometric features through these modules, 3D-FLEG can learn robust representations of new categories even with limited samples, while mitigating forgetting of the previously learned categories.

ICML,2025,Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn More,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77% percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP’s effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model’s focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models. Code has been submitted.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,BoxLM: Unifying Structures and Semantics of Medical Concepts for Diagnosis Prediction in Healthcare,"Language Models (LMs) have advanced diagnosis prediction by leveraging the semantic understanding of medical concepts in Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

In this paper, we propose BoxLM, a novel framework that unifies the structures and semantics of medical concepts for diagnosis prediction. Specifically, we propose a structure-semantic fusion mechanism via box embeddings, which integrates both ontology-driven and EHR-driven hierarchical structures with LM-based semantic embeddings, enabling interpretable medical concept representations.
Furthermore, in the box-aware diagnosis prediction module, an evolve-and-memorize patient box learning mechanism is proposed to model the temporal dynamics of patient visits, and a volume-based similarity measurement is proposed to enable accurate diagnosis prediction.

ICML,2025,Strategy Coopetition Explains the Emergence and Transience of In-Context Learning,"In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that emerges in transformer models, enabling them to learn from context without weight updates. Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that—after the disappearance of ICL—the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term “context-constrained in-weights learning” (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term “strategy coopetition”. We
propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Adversaries Can Misuse Combinations of Safe Models,"Developers try to evaluate whether an AI system can accomplish malicious tasks before releasing it; for example, they might test whether a model enables cyberoffense, user manipulation, or bioterrorism. In this work, we show that individually testing models for such misuse is inadequate; adversaries can misuse combinations of models even when each individual model is safe. The adversary accomplishes this by first decomposing tasks into subtasks, then solving each subtask with the best-suited model. For example, an adversary might solve challenging-but-benign subtasks with an aligned frontier model, and easy-but-malicious subtasks with a weaker misaligned model. We study two decomposition methods: manual decomposition where a human identifies a natural decomposition of a task, and automated decomposition where a weak model generates benign tasks for a frontier model to solve, then uses the solutions in-context to solve the original task. Using these decompositions, we empirically show that adversaries can create vulnerable code, explicit images, python scripts for hacking, and manipulative tweets at much higher rates with combinations of models than either individual model. Our work suggests that even perfectly-aligned frontier systems enable misuse without ever producing malicious outputs, and that red-teaming efforts should extend beyond single models in isolation.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2025,ICLShield: Exploring and Mitigating In-Context Learning Backdoor Attacks,"In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature. However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects, revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02\% on average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and defensive performance even for closed-source models (*e.g.*, GPT-4).",🛡️ 可靠性与安全

However, it faces challenges in brain interpretation, cross-modal context fusion and retention. In this paper, we present MindCustomer to explore the blending of visual brain signals in multi-context image generation. We first design shared neural data augmentation for stable cross-subject brain embedding by introducing the Image-Brain Translator (IBT) to generate brain responses from visual images. Then, we propose an effective cross-modal information fusion pipeline that mask-freely adapts distinct semantics from image and brain contexts within a diffusion model. It resolves semantic conflicts for context preservation and enables harmonious context integration. During the fusion pipeline, we further utilize the IBT to transfer image context to the brain representation to mitigate the cross-modal disparity. MindCustomer enables cross-subject generation, delivering unified, high-quality, and natural image outputs. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization for new subjects via few-shot learning, indicating the potential for practical application.

ICML,2025,AuPair: Golden Example Pairs for Code Repair,"Scaling up inference-time compute has proven to be a valuable strategy in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. An important task that can benefit from additional inference-time compute is self-repair; given an initial flawed response or guess, the LLM corrects its own mistake and produces an improved response or fix. We leverage the in-context learning ability of LLMs to perform self-repair in the coding domain. The key contribution of our paper is an approach that synthesises and selects an ordered set of golden example pairs, or AuPairs, of these initial guesses and subsequent fixes for the corresponding problems. Each such AuPair is provided as a single in-context example at inference time to generate a repaired solution. For an inference-time compute budget of $N$ LLM calls per problem, $N$ AuPairs are used to generate $N$ repaired solutions, out of which the highest-scoring solution is the final answer. The underlying intuition is that if the LLM is given a different example of fixing an incorrect guess each time, it can subsequently generate a diverse set of repaired solutions. Our algorithm selects these AuPairs in a manner that maximises complementarity and usefulness. We demonstrate the results of our algorithm on 5 LLMs across 7 competitive programming datasets for the code repair task. Our algorithm yields a significant boost in performance compared to best-of-$N$ and self-repair, and also exhibits strong generalisation across datasets and models. Moreover, our approach shows stronger scaling with inference-time compute budget compared to baselines.",🎯 特定技术方法

Existing multimodal diffusion finetuning methods largely focus on pixel-level reconstruction rather than in-context reasoning, and are constrained by the complexity and limited availability of reasoning-based datasets. ThinkDiff addresses these challenges by leveraging vision-language training as a proxy task, aligning VLMs with the decoder of an encoder-decoder large language model (LLM) instead of a diffusion decoder. This proxy task builds on the observation that the **LLM decoder** shares the same input feature space with **diffusion decoders** that use the corresponding **LLM encoder** for prompt embedding. As a result, aligning VLMs with diffusion decoders can be simplified through alignment with the LLM decoder. Without complex training and datasets, ThinkDiff effectively unleashes understanding, reasoning, and composing capabilities in diffusion models. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkDiff significantly improves accuracy from 19.2% to 46.3% on the challenging CoBSAT benchmark for multimodal in-context reasoning generation, with only 5 hours of training on 4 A100 GPUs.

ICML,2025,Behavior-agnostic Task Inference for Robust Offline In-context Reinforcement Learning,"The ability to adapt to new environments with noisy dynamics and unseen objectives is crucial for AI agents. In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a paradigm to build adaptive policies, employing a **context** trajectory of the test-time interactions to infer the true task and the corresponding optimal policy efficiently without gradient updates. However, ICRL policies heavily rely on context trajectories, making them vulnerable to distribution shifts from training to testing and degrading performance, particularly in offline settings where the training data is static. In this paper, we highlight that most existing offline ICRL methods are trained for approximate Bayesian inference based on the training distribution, rendering them vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time and resulting in poor generalization. To address this, we introduce Behavior-agnostic Task Inference (BATI) for ICRL, a model-based maximum-likelihood solution to infer the task representation robustly. In contrast to previous methods that rely on a learned encoder as the approximate posterior, BATI focuses purely on dynamics, thus insulating itself against the behavior of the context collection policy.

However, the performance degradation of the merged model remains a challenge, particularly when none or few data are available.

Building on this theoretical insight, we explore the relationship between model merging and distillation, introducing a novel few-shot merging algorithm, ProDistill (Progressive Layer-wise Distillation). Unlike common belief that layer-wise training hurts performance, we show that layer-wise teacher-student distillation not only enhances the scalability but also improves model merging performance.

ICML,2025,In-Context Adaptation to Concept Drift for Learned Database Operations,"Machine learning has demonstrated transformative potential for database operations, such as query optimization and in-database data analytics. However, dynamic database environments, characterized by frequent updates and evolving data distributions, introduce concept drift, which leads to performance degradation for learned models and limits their practical applicability. Addressing this challenge requires efficient frameworks capable of adapting to shifting concepts while minimizing the overhead of retraining or fine-tuning.

In this paper, we propose FLAIR, an online adaptation framework that introduces a new paradigm called \textit{in-context adaptation} for learned database operations. FLAIR leverages the inherent property of data systems, i.e., immediate availability of execution results for predictions, to enable dynamic context construction. By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\mathbf{x} | \mathcal{C}_t) \to \mathbf{y}$, with $\mathcal{C}_t$ representing a dynamic context memory, FLAIR delivers predictions aligned with the current concept, eliminating the need for runtime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR integrates two key modules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding task-specific features into standardized representations, and a Dynamic Decision Engine, pre-trained via Bayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly using contextual information at runtime.

ICML,2025,Continuously Updating Digital Twins using Large Language Models,"Digital twins are models of real-world systems that can simulate their dynamics in response to potential actions. In complex settings, the state and action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned encoders for sample retrieval.

ICML,2025,Latent Thought Models with Variational Bayes Inference-Time Computation,"We propose a novel class of language models, Latent Thought Models (LTMs), which incorporate explicit latent thought vectors that follow an explicit prior model in latent space. These latent thought vectors guide the autoregressive generation of ground tokens through a Transformer decoder. Training employs a dual-rate optimization process within the classical variational Bayes framework: fast learning of local variational parameters for the posterior distribution of latent vectors (inference-time computation), and slow learning of global decoder parameters. Empirical studies reveal that LTMs possess additional scaling dimensions beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the number of iterations in inference-time computation and number of latent thought vectors. Higher sample efficiency can be achieved by increasing training compute per token, with further gains possible by trading model size for more inference steps. Designed based on these scaling properties, LTMs demonstrate superior sample and parameter efficiency compared to autoregressive models and discrete diffusion models. They significantly outperform these counterparts in validation perplexity and zero-shot language modeling tasks. Additionally, LTMs exhibit emergent few-shot in-context reasoning capabilities that scale with model size, and achieve competitive performance in conditional and unconditional text generation.

It aims to pre-train a meta-model that can achieve few-shot adaptation for new tasks from human preference queries without relying on reward signals. To solve the problem, we propose the framework *adaptation via Preference-Order-preserving EMbedding* (POEM). In the meta-training, the framework learns a task encoder, which maps tasks to a preference-order-preserving task embedding space, and a decoder, which maps the embeddings to the task-specific policies. In the adaptation from human feedback, the task encoder facilitates efficient task embedding inference for new tasks from the preference queries and then obtains the task-specific policy. We provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of the adaptation process to the task-specific optimal policy and experimentally demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance with substantial improvement over baseline methods.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Understanding the Skill Gap in Recurrent Language Models: The Role of the Gather-and-Aggregate Mechanism,"State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences, but their fixed-size recurrent state limits capability on algorithmic tasks, such as retrieving past context.
In this work, we examine how in-context retrieval operates in Transformer- and SSM-based language models and find that both rely on a Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism:
a Gather Head extracts relevant information from context, which an Aggregate Head integrates into representation.
In both architectures, G&A concentrates in a few heads, forming bottlenecks even for simple retrieval.
For example, disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head in a pruned Llama-3.1-8B impairs retrieving the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing its accuracy from 66% to 25%.
Moreover, this retrieval bottleneck can obscure knowledge demands of tasks as the pruned model succeeds on MMLU with functioning G&A heads yet fails on other knowledge benchmarks.
The bottleneck similarly extends to tasks where SSMs typically underperform, like GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue.
We show that SSMs' retrieval challenges manifest in these heads, creating smoother attention patterns instead of the sharp transitions effective G&A requires.
Thus, the Transformer-SSM retrieval gap exists in just a few heads, rather than the entire language model.
% Result 3: Analyzing Hybrid models
This suggests a unified explanation for Transformer vs. SSM performance gap while showing how to merge their strengths.
We find that pretrained hybrid models, where SSMs are combined with attention layers, delegate the role of Aggregate Heads to attention.
Similarly, replacing a single G&A head in a pretrained SSM with an attention variant boosts retrieval and benchmark scores.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,TRUST-VLM: Thorough Red-Teaming for Uncovering Safety Threats in Vision-Language Models,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a cornerstone in multi-modal artificial intelligence, enabling seamless integration of visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. Despite their impressive capabilities, these models often exhibit inherent vulnerabilities that can lead to safety failures in critical applications. 
Red-teaming is an important approach to identify and test system's vulnerabilities, but how to conduct red-teaming for contemporary VLMs is an unexplored area. 
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal red-teaming approach, TRUST-VLM, to enhance both the attack success rate and the diversity of successful test cases for VLMs. 
Specifically, TRUST-VLM is built upon the in-context learning to adversarially test a VLM on both image and text inputs. Furthermore, we involve feedback from the target VLM to improve the efficiency of test case generation. Extensive experiments show that TRUST-VLM not only outperforms traditional red-teaming techniques in generating diverse and effective adversarial cases but also provides actionable insights for model improvement. 
These findings highlight the importance of advanced red-teaming strategies in ensuring the reliability of VLMs.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,Divide and Conquer: Exploring Language-centric Tree Reasoning for Video Question-Answering,"Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) remains challenging in achieving advanced cognitive reasoning due to the uncontrollable and opaque reasoning processes in existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose a novel Language-centric Tree Reasoning (LTR) framework that targets on enhancing the reasoning ability of models. In detail, it recursively divides the original question into logically manageable parts and conquers them piece by piece, enhancing the reasoning capabilities and interpretability of existing MLLMs. Specifically, in the first stage, the LTR focuses on language to recursively generate a language-centric logical tree, which gradually breaks down the complex cognitive question into simple perceptual ones and plans the reasoning path through a RAG-based few-shot approach. In the second stage, with the aid of video content, the LTR performs bottom-up logical reasoning within the tree to derive the final answer along with the traceable reasoning path. Experiments across 11 VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our LTR framework significantly improves both accuracy and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to implement a language-centric logical tree to guide MLLM reasoning in VideoQA, paving the way for language-centric video understanding from perception to cognition.",🧠 推理与思维链
ICML,2025,Probabilistic Interactive 3D Segmentation with Hierarchical Neural Processes,"Interactive 3D segmentation has emerged as a promising solution for generating accurate object masks in complex 3D scenes by incorporating user-provided clicks. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) effectively generalizing from sparse user clicks to produce accurate segmentations and (2) quantifying predictive uncertainty to help users identify unreliable regions. In this work, we propose \emph{NPISeg3D}, a novel probabilistic framework that builds upon Neural Processes (NPs) to address these challenges. Specifically, NPISeg3D introduces a hierarchical latent variable structure with scene-specific and object-specific latent variables to enhance few-shot generalization by capturing both global context and object-specific characteristics. Additionally, we design a probabilistic prototype modulator that adaptively modulates click prototypes with object-specific latent variables, improving the model’s ability to capture object-aware context and quantify predictive uncertainty. Experiments on four  3D point cloud datasets demonstrate that NPISeg3D achieves superior segmentation performance with fewer clicks while providing reliable uncertainty estimations.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2025,EPIC: Efficient Position-Independent Caching for Serving Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) show great capabilities in a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as requests (prompts) become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by reusing Key-Value (KV) vectors, the intermediate representations of tokens that are repeated across requests. However, existing context caching requires exact prefix matches across requests, limiting reuse cases in settings such as few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation, where immutable content (e.g., documents) remains unchanged across requests but is preceded by varying prefixes. Position-Independent
Caching (PIC) addresses this issue by enabling modular reuse of the KV vectors regardless of prefixes. We formalize PIC and advance prior work by introducing EPIC, a serving system incorporating our new LegoLink algorithm, which mitigates the inappropriate “attention sink” effect at every document beginning, to maintain accuracy with minimal computation. Experiments show that EPIC achieves up to 8× improvements in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7× throughput gains over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss.",🎯 特定技术方法
ICML,2025,IMTS is Worth Time $\times$ Channel Patches: Visual Masked Autoencoders for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction,"Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose **VIMTS**, a framework adapting **V**isual MAE for **IMTS** forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks.

ICML,2025,LMAct: A Benchmark for In-Context Imitation Learning with Long Multimodal Demonstrations,"In this paper, we present a benchmark to pressure-test today’s frontier models’ multimodal decision-making capabilities in the very long-context regime (up to one million tokens) and investigate whether these models can learn from large numbers of expert demonstrations in their context. We evaluate the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and o1 as policies across a battery of simple interactive decision-making tasks: playing tic-tac-toe, chess, and Atari, navigating grid worlds, solving crosswords, and controlling a simulated cheetah. We study increasing amounts of expert demonstrations in the context — from no demonstrations to 512 full episodes. Across our tasks, models rarely manage to fully reach expert performance, and often, presenting more demonstrations has little effect. Some models steadily improve with more demonstrations on a few tasks. We investigate the effect of encoding observations as text or images and the impact of chain-of-thought prompting. To help quantify the impact of other approaches and future innovations, we open source our benchmark that covers the zero-, few-, and many-shot regimes in a unified evaluation.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,"Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective","We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent ''gibberish'' can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the ''gibberish'' always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature—such as symbiosis and self-organization—arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
ICML,2025,KV Shifting Attention Enhances Language Modeling,"Current large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on decode-only transformer architectures, which exhibit exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is widely acknowledged that the cornerstone of their ICL ability lies in the induction heads mechanism, which necessitates at least two layers of attention. To more effectively harness the model's induction capabilities, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and provide theoretical proof that KV shifting attention reduces the model's dependency on the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results confirm that KV shifting attention enhances the learning of induction heads and improves language modeling performance. This leads to superior performance or accelerated convergence, spanning from toy models to pre-trained models with over 10 billion parameters.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Plausible Token Amplification for Improving Accuracy of Differentially Private In-Context Learning Based on Implicit Bayesian Inference,"We propose Plausible Token Amplification (PTA) to improve the accuracy of Differentially Private In-Context Learning (DP-ICL) using DP synthetic demonstrations. While Tang et al. empirically improved the accuracy of DP-ICL by limiting vocabulary space during DP synthetic demonstration generation, its theoretical basis remains unexplored. By interpreting ICL as implicit Bayesian inference on a concept underlying demonstrations, we not only provide theoretical evidence supporting Tang et al.'s empirical method but also introduce PTA, a refined method for modifying next-token probability distribution. Through the modification, PTA highlights tokens that distinctly represent the ground-truth concept underlying the original demonstrations. As a result, generated DP synthetic demonstrations guide the Large Language Model to successfully infer the ground-truth concept, which improves the accuracy of DP-ICL. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world text-classification datasets validated the effectiveness of PTA.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Training Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Attention,"While attention-based models have demonstrated the remarkable ability of in-context learning (ICL), the theoretical understanding of how these models acquired this ability through gradient descent training is still preliminary. Towards answering this question, we study the gradient descent dynamics of multi-head linear self-attention trained for in-context linear regression. We examine two parametrizations of linear self-attention: one with the key and query weights merged as a single matrix (common in theoretical studies), and one with separate key and query matrices (closer to practical settings). For the merged parametrization, we show that the training dynamics has two fixed points and the loss trajectory exhibits a single, abrupt drop. We derive an analytical time-course solution for a certain class of datasets and initialization. For the separate parametrization, we show that the training dynamics has exponentially many fixed points and the loss exhibits saddle-to-saddle dynamics, which we reduce to scalar ordinary differential equations. During training, the model implements principal component regression in context with the number of principal components increasing over training time. Overall, we provide a theoretical description of how ICL abilities evolve during gradient descent training of linear attention, revealing abrupt acquisition or progressive improvements depending on how the key and query are parametrized.",🤖 应用：Agent与工具使用
ICML,2025,ConText: Driving In-context Learning for Text Removal and Segmentation,"This paper presents the first study on adapting the visual in-context learning (V-ICL) paradigm to optical character recognition tasks, specifically focusing on text removal and segmentation. Most existing V-ICL generalists employ a reasoning-as-reconstruction approach: they turn to using a straightforward image-label compositor as the prompt and query input, and then masking the query label to generate the desired output. This direct prompt confines the model to a challenging single-step reasoning process. To address this, we propose a task-chaining compositor in the form of image-removal-segmentation, providing an enhanced prompt that elicits reasoning with enriched intermediates. Additionally, we introduce context-aware aggregation, integrating the chained prompt pattern into the latent query representation, thereby strengthening the model's in-context reasoning. We also consider the issue of visual heterogeneity, which complicates the selection of homogeneous demonstrations in text recognition. Accordingly, this is effectively addressed through a simple self-prompting strategy, preventing the model's in-context learnability from devolving into specialist-like, context-free inference. Collectively, these insights culminate in our ConText model, which achieves new state-of-the-art across both in- and out-of-domain benchmarks.

ICML,2025,Trajectory World Models for Heterogeneous Environments,"Heterogeneity in sensors and actuators across environments poses a significant challenge to building large-scale pre-trained world models on top of this low-dimensional sensor information. In this work, we explore pre-training world models for heterogeneous environments by addressing key transfer barriers in both data diversity and model flexibility. We introduce UniTraj, a unified dataset comprising over one million trajectories from 80 environments, designed to scale data while preserving critical diversity. Additionally, we propose TrajWorld, a novel architecture capable of flexibly handling varying sensor and actuator information and capturing environment dynamics in-context. Pre-training TrajWorld on UniTraj yields substantial gains in transition prediction, achieves a new state-of-the-art for off-policy evaluation, and also delivers superior online performance of model predictive control. To the best of our knowledge, this work, for the first time, demonstrates the transfer benefits of world models across heterogeneous and complex control environments.

ICML,2025,Fast and Robust: Task Sampling with Posterior and Diversity Synergies for Adaptive Decision-Makers in Randomized Environments,"Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making.
Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations.
The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models can surrogate policy evaluation. 
This work characterizes robust active task sampling as a secret Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios.
Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making.
Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2025,Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Reinforcement Learning,"Diversity in demonstration selection is critical for enhancing model generalization by enabling broader coverage of structures and concepts. Constructing appropriate demonstration sets remains a key research challenge. This paper introduces the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for tasks amenable to in-context learning (ICL), particularly text classification and reasoning, in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs frameworks like Q-learning and a PPO-based variant to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity (quantified by label distribution) and relevance to the task objective. This strategy ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including diverse reasoning tasks, and involving 14 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances performance compared to ten established baselines. Our evaluation includes analysis of performance across varying numbers of demonstrations on selected datasets. Furthermore, we investigate incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which further boosts predictive performance. The results highlight the potential of RL for adaptive demonstration selection and addressing challenges in ICL.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Hypo3D: Exploring Hypothetical Reasoning in 3D,"The rise of vision-language foundation models marks an advancement in bridging the gap between human and machine capabilities in 3D scene reasoning. Existing 3D reasoning benchmarks assume real-time scene accessibility, which is impractical due to the high cost of frequent scene updates. To this end, we introduce *Hypothetical 3D Reasoning*, namely Hypo3D, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to reason without access to real-time scene data. Models need to imagine the scene state based on a provided change description before reasoning. Hypo3D is formulated as a 3D Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark, comprising 7,727 context changes across 700 indoor scenes, resulting in 14,885 question-answer pairs. An anchor-based world frame is established for all scenes, ensuring consistent reference to a global frame for directional terms in context changes and QAs. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art foundation models struggle to reason effectively in hypothetically changed scenes. This reveals a substantial performance gap compared to humans, particularly in scenarios involving movement changes and directional reasoning. Even when the change is irrelevant to the question, models often incorrectly adjust their answers.

ICML,2025,BDC-CLIP: Brownian Distance Covariance for Adapting CLIP to Action Recognition,"Bridging contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to video action recognition has attracted growing interest. Human actions are inherently rich in spatial and temporal contexts, involving dynamic interactions among people, objects, and the environment. Accurately recognizing actions requires effectively capturing these fine-grained elements and modeling their relationships with language. However, most existing methods rely on cosine similarity--practically equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient--between global tokens for video-language alignment. As a result, they have limited capacity to model complex dependencies and tend to overlook local tokens that encode critical spatio-temporal cues. To overcome these limitations, we propose BDC-CLIP, a novel framework that leverages Brownian Distance Covariance (BDC) to align visual and textual representations. Our method can capture complex relationships--both linear and nonlinear--between all visual and textual tokens, enabling fine-grained modeling in space, time, and language. BDC-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across zero-shot, few-shot, base-to-novel, and fully supervised action recognition settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and broad applicability.",🏗️ 模型训练与架构
ICML,2025,In-Context Learning as Conditioned Associative Memory Retrieval,"We provide an exactly solvable example for interpreting In-Context Learning (ICL) with one-layer attention models as conditional retrieval of dense associative memory models.
Our main contribution is to interpret ICL as memory reshaping in the modern Hopfield model from a conditional memory set (in-context examples).
Specifically, we show that the in-context sequential examples induce an effective reshaping of the energy landscape of a Hopfield model.
We integrate this in-context memory reshaping phenomenon into the existing Bayesian model averaging view of ICL [Zhang et al., AISTATS 2025] via the established equivalence between the modern Hopfield model and transformer attention.
Under this unique perspective, we not only characterize how in-context examples shape predictions in the Gaussian linear regression case, but also recover the known $\epsilon$-stability generalization bound of the ICL for the one-layer attention model.
We also give explanations for three key behaviors of ICL and validate them through experiments.",🔬 机理理解与可解释性
ICML,2025,Customizing the Inductive Biases of Softmax Attention using Structured Matrices,"The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention.",🧺 其他/未归类
ICML,2025,Offline Opponent Modeling with Truncated Q-driven Instant Policy Refinement,"Offline Opponent Modeling (OOM) aims to learn an adaptive autonomous agent policy that dynamically adapts to opponents using an offline dataset from multi-agent games. Previous work assumes that the dataset is optimal. However, this assumption is difficult to satisfy in the real world. When the dataset is suboptimal, existing approaches struggle to work. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general algorithmic improvement framework, Truncated Q-driven Instant Policy Refinement (TIPR), to handle the suboptimality of OOM algorithms induced by datasets. The TIPR framework is plug-and-play in nature. Compared to original OOM algorithms, it requires only two extra steps: (1) Learn a horizon-truncated in-context action-value function, namely Truncated Q, using the offline dataset. The Truncated Q estimates the expected return within a fixed, truncated horizon and is conditioned on opponent information. (2) Use the learned Truncated Q to instantly decide whether to perform policy refinement and to generate policy after refinement during testing. Theoretically, we analyze the rationale of Truncated Q from the perspective of No Maximization Bias probability. Empirically, we conduct extensive comparison and ablation experiments in four representative competitive environments. TIPR effectively improves various OOM algorithms pretrained with suboptimal datasets.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Unlocking the Power of SAM 2 for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models (e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG) features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot mIoU can be 4.2\% better than the best baseline.",🛡️ 可靠性与安全
ICML,2025,Can Transformers Learn Full Bayesian Inference in Context?,"Transformers have emerged as the dominant architecture in the field of deep learning, with a broad range of applications and remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. While not yet fully understood, ICL has already proved to be an intriguing phenomenon, allowing transformers to learn in context—without requiring further training. In this paper, we further advance the understanding of ICL by demonstrating that transformers can perform full Bayesian inference for commonly used statistical models in context. More specifically, we introduce a general framework that builds on ideas from prior fitted networks and continuous normalizing flows and enables us to infer complex posterior distributions for models such as generalized linear models and latent factor models. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our ICL approach yields posterior samples that are similar in quality to state-of-the-art MCMC or variational inference methods that do not operate in context.

ICML,2025,Time-VLM: Exploring Multimodal Vision-Language Models for Augmented Time Series Forecasting,"Recent advancements in time series forecasting have explored augmenting models with text or vision modalities to improve accuracy. While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.

ICML,2025,Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network for Few-shot Out-of-distribution Detection,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many ID samples for training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where only a few labeled ID samples are available. Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter- and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity of ID image samples, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images, engineering learnable ID and OOD textual prompts. Specifically, we first generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts, and label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art works.",📊 评测基准与数据集
ICML,2025,Revisiting Continuity of Image Tokens for Cross-domain Few-shot Learning,"Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data, which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens, encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works.

ICML,2025,Random Registers for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,"Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises (i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance. We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition. This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/shuaiyi308/REAP.",📚 Prompt工程与优化
